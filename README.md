# Case Tools
 This app allows you to download and upload files to Epicors case system. 

 Upon first opening the tool you will be met with a series of warning messages these are just to state that your settings are not setup yet. Go into the settings tab and set all settings: 

Base URL: This is the base epicor URL NOT including any additional sections. IE: https://epicor.yourcompany.com/epicorversion
API Key: Generate an API Key in Epicor and paste here
Basic Auth: Use your username and password to create a basic Auth key. One option is: https://www.debugbear.com/basic-auth-header-generator. Include the "Basic " before the key. 
Doc Path: This is where you want to save and upload documents to. The tool will generate a folder in this path for each case. 
Always On Top: Set this to true to keep the app on top of other windows at all times. Note that you will need to close and reopen the app for this to take effect.
