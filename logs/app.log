Requirements:  I am requesting the fields from the Power Systems team right now so this might be delayed a bit but we need the following: PO lines (1 to many orders, 1 to many order lines) from several different companies will be sent in by email to an outlook email account (specified only for this purpose) with a .csv or excel formatted attachment at all times of the day and all days of the week. The flow will open the email and open the attachment It will load all PO lines to a temp table in a SQL database A comparison will be made between newly added PO lines and view or order lines for customer in SQL view by a concatenated field of Customer Num, PO Num, PO Line to Customer Num, PO Num, Order Dtl Line. Only create new orders and order line items in Epicor for each unique line. Total all orders and lines generated in file and send in report to customer email on file. If there is an error, send by email to IT or Sales contact by email. When process complete, clear temp table and rename email subject to add – complete Wait on next email to process orders. .', 'DesignProblem': '  Power Systems needs to import order information into Epicor. These orders will be delivered as CSV files attached to emails from a variety of addresses. Orders will be created, however updates will NOT be allowed. If duplicate data (i.e., A second copy of an order) is received, it should generate an error. After order information is processed, an email needs to be dispatched to either IT or the customer depending on success of the import.', 'DesignSolution': ' Order Import Service This will be an Windows Service that is configured to poll for new emails on a recurring schedule. The schedule will be configurable and support intervals as short as every minute. This service will check a specified mailbox and look for unread emails with CSV attachments. Emails without attachments, or with non-CSV attachments will be ignored. When a relevant email is located, the following logic will be executed: Attachment and source address will be collected from the email and passed to an Order Creator function.  Described in following section. This is an internal function within this service. It is described separately for the sake of clarity. If Order Creator is able to successfully import the file: Email(s) will be sent to the customer(s) associated with the resulting orders. The original email will then be deleted. If Order Creator fails to import the file:  An email will be dispatched to a static address for Power Systems’ IT department. This message will be a forwarded copy of the original email with details of the error appended. Original email will be marked as read and left in the mailbox. This service will have the following options which will be configurable by editing a ‘standard’ .NET-style XML configuration file. App Server URL  Server hosting the Epicor application Instance Epicor Instance where orders should be sent\nE.g., Test, Pilot, Production, etc Epicor User Epicor Password Polling Interval Interval between polls for new messages.  Denominated in seconds. Test Mode If the service is placed in Test Mode, emails will not be deleted after processing. Messages will be left in place and re-imported at the next polling event. This is intended to support iterative testing without requiring repetitive generation of new messages. \ni.e., Allows import logic to be tested repeatedly on the same message(s). Failure Email Address to notify when an import fails. BCC Email Optional. All emails generated by this service will be BCC’d to this address. SMTP Server SMTP Port SMTP User SMTP Password Expose Importer Webservice It this flag is set, the Order Importer function (described below) will be exposed as a web service. Note: This service will use NLog for logging. There will be an additional file to configure logging options in the standard NLog format. Details on NLog configuration can be found on the NLog website:\n  Order Importer This is a function within the service. It will be exposed as a webservice based on a configuration flag. This function will accept CSV data originating in attachments to emails parsed by this service. (CSV’s will be converted to a datatable or similar object before being passed to the function.) Note: This design and the associated quote assumes all CSV files will be in the same format. If multiple formats need to be supported, additional development time may be required. This function will review the Customer Number and PO Number to determine whether a corresponding sales order exists in the system. If the sales order exists, an error will be generated. Epicor will not be modified and the originating email will be forwarded to Power Systems’ IT department. If the order does not exist, it will be created. Lines will be added for each row within the CSV file. Upon successful creation of the order, an email will be dispatched to the default email address for the customer. The message will contain the following information for each order/line created: PO Number Sales Order Number Ship To Address Line Number Part Number Quantity  Unit Price Extended Price Total PO Price  This is the ‘final’ PO price, inclusive of all taxes, fees, discounts, etc that have been configured within Epicor.', 'DesignUnitTests': 'Test: Send email with CSV for new order\n Result: Order should be created in Epicor.

The API currently being used requires 3 calls and takes an unreasonable amount of time to comelete. Additionally, the current solution relies on a dedicated “Amazon Freight” button which users must be made aware of and trained on. They would prefer to have a single “Freight” function in Customer Shipment Entry that will generate the correct label without requiring special knowledge or steps by the user. Note: \nThe AT API requires “SellingParty” and “ShipFromParty” values to be provided. This design assums that Midwest will be able to provide these values or let Six S know where to retrieve them when development begins.', 'DesignSolution': ' Label Retrieval Six S will create an Epicor Function that connects to the Amazon Transportation API (documentation provided by Midwest) and retrieves a label for a given shipment. This function will take the following parameters: Pack number Current user’s workstation (Used to identify printer) The function will lookup the PO Number on the Sales Order associated with the shipment. It will then make a call to AT’s “CreateShippingLabelsRequest” web service. If the AT service returns an error, the message will be relayed to the end user. If a label is returned it will be printed on the default label printer associated with the specified workstation. This function will be used to replace the current logic used for printing Amazon labels. Customer Shipment Entry This screen will be modified to merge the functionality of the “Amazon Freight” button with the standard “Freight” function. Both buttons will be removed/hidden and a new custom “Freight” function will be added. When triggered, this function will perform the following steps: Review Ship Via to determine if the current pack is shipping via AT or an alternate method. If the pack is shipping via AT: The custom “Label Retrieval” function will be triggered to retrieve an AT shipping label. This label will be printed at the default label printer for the user’s workstation. The pack will be marked “Shipped”. Processing will complete. If the pack is shipping via a non-AT method: The standard Epicor freight logic will be triggered. Essentially, the new button will replicate the standard “Freight” button with the addition of the ability to properly generate and print labels for AT shipments.  Fulfillment Workbench This screen has an existing SMP button that generates shipments on the My Selections tab.  This function will be modified to also generate and print labels for any orders that are shipping via AT. If an order is shipping via AT, the following steps will be executed: The custom “Label Retrieval” function will be triggered to retrieve an AT shipping label. This label will be printed at the default label printer for the user’s workstation. The pack will be marked “Shipped”. Processing will proceed to the next order. Note: This function was developed quite some time ago. It may benefit from refactoring to bring the code inline with current best practices. If minor refactoring is needed, it will be done as part of this project. If more extensive refactoring is warranted, Six S will contact Midwest to discuss the issues that have been identified, time required to rectify and related decisions.', 'DesignUnitTests': 'Test: Click “Freight” on a pack shipping via AT\n Result: AT label should be retrieved and printed.\nTest: Click “Freight on a non-AT pack\n Result: Standard Epicor freighting logic should execute.'}

If duplicate data (i.e., A second copy of an order) is received, it should generate an error. After order information is processed, an email needs to be dispatched to either IT or the customer depending on success of the import.', 'DesignSolution': ' Order Import Service This will be an Windows Service that is configured to poll for new emails on a recurring schedule. The schedule will be configurable and support intervals as short as every minute. This service will check a specified mailbox and look for unread emails with CSV attachments. Emails without attachments, or with non-CSV attachments will be ignored. When a relevant email is located, the following logic will be executed: Attachment and source address will be collected from the email and passed to an Order Creator function.  Described in following section. This is an internal function within this service. It is described separately for the sake of clarity. If Order Creator is able to successfully import the file: Email(s) will be sent to the customer(s) associated with the resulting orders. The original email will then be deleted. If Order Creator fails to import the file:  An email will be dispatched to a static address for Power Systems’ IT department.

App Server URL  Server hosting the Epicor application Instance Epicor Instance where orders should be sent\nE.g., Test, Pilot, Production, etc Epicor User Epicor Password Polling Interval Interval between polls for new messages.  Denominated in seconds. Test Mode If the service is placed in Test Mode, emails will not be deleted after processing. Messages will be left in place and re-imported at the next polling event. This is intended to support iterative testing without requiring repetitive generation of new messages. \ni.e., Allows import logic to be tested repeatedly on the same message(s). Failure Email Address to notify when an import fails. BCC Email Optional. All emails generated by this service will be BCC’d to this address. SMTP Server SMTP Port SMTP User SMTP Password Expose Importer Webservice It this flag is set, the Order Importer function (described below) will be exposed as a web service. Note: This service will use NLog for logging. There will be an additional file to configure logging options in the standard NLog format. Details on NLog configuration can be found on the NLog website:\n  Order Importer This is a function within the service. It will be exposed as a webservice based on a configuration flag. This function will accept CSV data originating in attachments to emails parsed by this service. (CSV’s will be converted to a datatable or similar object before being passed to the function.) Note: This design and the associated quote assumes all CSV files will be in the same format. If multiple formats need to be supported, additional development time may be required. This function will review the Customer Number and PO Number to determine whether a corresponding sales order exists in the system. If the sales order exists, an error will be generated. Epicor will not be modified and the originating email will be forwarded to Power Systems’ IT department. If the order does not exist, it will be created. Lines will be added for each row within the CSV file. Upon successful creation of the order, an email will be dispatched to the default email address for the customer. The message will contain the following information for each order/line created: PO Number Sales Order Number Ship To Address Line Number Part Number Quantity  Unit Price Extended Price Total PO Price  This is the ‘final’ PO price, inclusive of all taxes, fees, discounts, etc that have been configured within Epicor.', 'DesignUnitTests': 'Test: Send email with CSV for new order\n Result: Order should be created in Epicor.

This label will be printed at the default label printer for the user’s workstation. The pack will be marked “Shipped”. Processing will complete. If the pack is shipping via a non-AT method: The standard Epicor freight logic will be triggered. Essentially, the new button will replicate the standard “Freight” button with the addition of the ability to properly generate and print labels for AT shipments.  Fulfillment Workbench This screen has an existing SMP button that generates shipments on the My Selections tab.  This function will be modified to also generate and print labels for any orders that are shipping via AT. If an order is shipping via AT, the following steps will be executed: The custom “Label Retrieval” function will be triggered to retrieve an AT shipping label. This label will be printed at the default label printer for the user’s workstation. The pack will be marked “Shipped”. Processing will proceed to the next order. Note: This function was developed quite some time ago. It may benefit from refactoring to bring the code inline with current best practices. If minor refactoring is needed, it will be done as part of this project. If more extensive refactoring is warranted, Six S will contact Midwest to discuss the issues that have been identified, time required to rectify and related decisions.', 'DesignUnitTests': 'Test: Click “Freight” on a pack shipping via AT\n Result: AT label should be retrieved and printed.\nTest: Click “Freight on a non-AT pack\n Result: Standard Epicor freighting logic should execute.'}

Do you have any 6S team members that are power users of Service Connect? We have several seats of Epicor Enterprise Edition Service Connect Run Time Only which means that we can run flows but we cannot create them. If we gave you requirements could a 6S team member create a flow for us to be able to incorporate in our instance to import orders from a .csv file either in a network folder or as an email is received to a specific inbox with a .csv attachment to be processed. There is some urgency to this request. Requirements:  I am requesting the fields from the Power Systems team right now so this might be delayed a bit but we need the following: PO lines (1 to many orders, 1 to many order lines) from several different companies will be sent in by email to an outlook email account (specified only for this purpose) with a .csv or excel formatted attachment at all times of the day and all days of the week. The flow will open the email and open the attachment It will load all PO lines to a temp table in a SQL database A comparison will be made between newly added PO lines and view or order lines for customer in SQL view by a concatenated field of Customer Num, PO Num, PO Line to Customer Num, PO Num, Order Dtl Line. Only create new orders and order line items in Epicor for each unique line. Total all orders and lines generated in file and send in report to customer email on file. If there is an error, send by email to IT or Sales contact by email. When process complete, clear temp table and rename email subject to add – complete Wait on next email to process orders. .-1', [-0.02822106145322323, -0.012948734685778618, -0.030671391636133194,

orders from our different businesses to our Epicor instance. Do you have any 6S team members that are power users of Service Connect? We have several seats of Epicor Enterprise Edition Service Connect Run Time Only which means that we can run flows but we cannot create them. If we gave you requirements could a 6S team member create a flow for us to be able to incorporate in our instance to import orders from a .csv file either in a network folder or as an email is received to a specific inbox with a .csv attachment to be processed. There is some urgency to this request. Requirements:  I am requesting the fields from the Power Systems team right now so this might be delayed a bit but we need the following: PO lines (1 to many orders, 1 to many order lines) from several different companies will be sent in by email to an outlook email account (specified only for this purpose) with a .csv or excel formatted attachment at all times of the day and all days of the week. The flow will open the email and open the attachment It will load all PO lines to a temp table in a SQL database A comparison will be made between newly added PO lines and view or order lines for customer in SQL view by a concatenated field of Customer Num, PO Num, PO Line to Customer Num, PO Num, Order Dtl Line. Only create new orders and order line items in Epicor for each unique line. Total all orders and lines generated in file and send in report to customer email on file. If there is an error, send by email to IT or Sales contact by email. When process complete, clear temp table and rename email subject to add – complete Wait on next email to process orders. .', 'ChunkNumber': 1})]

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added.

Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added.

Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added.

Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added.

Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

We will add a command button on the Customer Shipment Entry screen with the label “Generate Bill of Lading”.  The command button will only be enabled when the Customer Shipment Entry has been saved and the Pack has not shipped.    When the button is clicked, the system first looks for a linked Bill of Lading.   If one exists, it will be deleted.  The system then generates a new Bill of Lading.    The requirement is to automate the process of generating a Bill of Lading using the current Pack ID.  Once the Bill of Lading has been generated, a slide out panel should display with a success message and the new Bill of Lading ID.

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added. Report Qty 6.\tAdd the following: a.\tSerial Number: A field where users can scan or manually input the serial number. b.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal c.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal d.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal e.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. f.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox  7.\tHide the following: a.\tResource, Resource Name, Next Assembly, Next Opr Seq, Revision, PCID, Lot, Request Move, Attribute Set, Total Qty and UOM, Print Contents, Serial Numbers Button, Generate PCID Button, Next Lot Button, Co Parts Tab, Labor Equipment Tab, Inspection Data Button  8.\tMake the following Read Only: a.\tCurrent Qty and UOM b.\tJob c.\tAssembly d.\tOperation  9.\tAdd the following read only fields For the specific fields that need to display data from lower-level serial numbers (e.g., compressor serial, controller serial, evaporator serial, gateway serial), fetch the data by searching for matched serial numbers with the required part classes.  Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

When the button is clicked, the system first looks for a linked Bill of Lading.   If one exists, it will be deleted.  The system then generates a new Bill of Lading.    The requirement is to automate the process of generating a Bill of Lading using the current Pack ID.  Once the Bill of Lading has been generated, a slide out panel should display with a success message and the new Bill of Lading ID.

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added. Report Qty 6.\tAdd the following: a.\tSerial Number: A field where users can scan or manually input the serial number. b.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal c.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal d.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal e.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. f.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox  7.\tHide the following: a.\tResource, Resource Name, Next Assembly, Next Opr Seq, Revision, PCID, Lot, Request Move, Attribute Set, Total Qty and UOM, Print Contents, Serial Numbers Button, Generate PCID Button, Next Lot Button, Co Parts Tab, Labor Equipment Tab, Inspection Data Button  8.\tMake the following Read Only: a.\tCurrent Qty and UOM b.\tJob c.\tAssembly d.\tOperation  9.\tAdd the following read only fields For the specific fields that need to display data from lower-level serial numbers (e.g., compressor serial, controller serial, evaporator serial, gateway serial), fetch the data by searching for matched serial numbers with the required part classes.  Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added. Report Qty 6.\tAdd the following: a.\tSerial Number: A field where users can scan or manually input the serial number. b.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal c.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal d.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal e.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. f.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox  7.\tHide the following: a.\tResource, Resource Name, Next Assembly, Next Opr Seq, Revision, PCID, Lot, Request Move, Attribute Set, Total Qty and UOM, Print Contents, Serial Numbers Button, Generate PCID Button, Next Lot Button, Co Parts Tab, Labor Equipment Tab, Inspection Data Button  8.\tMake the following Read Only: a.\tCurrent Qty and UOM b.\tJob c.\tAssembly d.\tOperation  9.\tAdd the following read only fields For the specific fields that need to display data from lower-level serial numbers (e.g., compressor serial, controller serial, evaporator serial, gateway serial), fetch the data by searching for matched serial numbers with the required part classes.  Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

The requirement is to automate the process of generating a Bill of Lading using the current Pack ID.  Once the Bill of Lading has been generated, a slide out panel should display with a success message and the new Bill of Lading ID.

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed.

Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen.

The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

This includes product details, quantities, prices, and any other relevant information that will be included in the sales order.\n\n3. **Converting the Quote**: Use the 'Convert to Sales Order' function or a similar feature within Kinetic to initiate the conversion of the quote into a sales order. This step may involve selecting an option such as 'Create Sales Order from Quote' or using a convert function within the quotes module.\n\n4. **Creating Order Lines**: If necessary, break down the quoted items into individual order lines. Each line should have its own specifications, pricing, and any other required details.\n\n5. **Confirming the Sales Order**: After the quote has been converted and all order lines are created, you will need to confirm the details of the new sales order. This may involve reviewing product information, delivery details, and other terms of the sale.\n\n6. **Saving the Sales Order**: Once all details are confirmed and you are satisfied with the information, save the new sales order in the system. This action typically finalizes the conversion process and may initiate the order fulfillment process.\n\n7. **Order Fulfillment**: After the sales order is saved, Kinetic will likely have a set of processes for fulfilling the order. This could include inventory checks, shipping arrangements, and invoicing.\n\n8. **Finalization**: To finalize the creation of an order line from a quote, after you have filled in the details and made any necessary changes, you would select 'OK' to confirm inside the 'Get Quote Line For Order' panel, and then complete the sales order.\n\nThroughout this process, it's important to ensure that each step is completed accurately to prevent any issues with the order. If the CRM module is enabled in Kinetic, converting a quote to a sales order might also involve marking the quote as won, which could automatically generate an order.\n\nPlease note that the exact steps and terminology may vary depending on the version of Kinetic you are using and any customizations that have been made to your system. If you require more detailed instructions, including screenshots or specific button locations, you should refer to the sales order processing section of the Kinetic user guide or reach out to your system administrator for assistance."}

2023-11-23 20:01:23,794 - services.omnaiService - DEBUG - Response: {'response': "Yes, in C#, you can use the `async` and `await` keywords to tell the code to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete before continuing execution. This is useful when you need to make calls that may take some time to complete, such as web service calls, without blocking the main thread and freezing the user interface.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might use `async` and `await` in a function:\n\n```csharp\nprivate async Task MyAsyncFunction()\n{\n    // This line will start the operation and then immediately return control to the caller\n    var result = await SomeLongRunningOperationAsync();\n\n    // The following lines of code will not execute until SomeLongRunningOperationAsync has completed\n    // You can work with the result here\n    ProcessResult(result);\n}\n\nprivate async Task<ResultType> SomeLongRunningOperationAsync()\n{\n    // Simulate a long-running operation\n    await Task.Delay(2000); // Waits for 2 seconds asynchronously\n    return new ResultType(); // Replace with actual operation and result\n}\n\nprivate void ProcessResult(ResultType result)\n{\n    // Process the result here\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyAsyncFunction` is an asynchronous method that calls another asynchronous method `SomeLongRunningOperationAsync` using `await`. The `await` keyword causes the execution of `MyAsyncFunction` to pause until `SomeLongRunningOperationAsync` completes, at which point it resumes with the result.\n\nRemember to handle exceptions that may occur during asynchronous operations and consider the use of `ConfigureAwait(false)` if you don't need to resume on the original synchronization context (e.g., in a library code that doesn't interact with the UI)."}
