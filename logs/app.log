Requirements:  I am requesting the fields from the Power Systems team right now so this might be delayed a bit but we need the following: PO lines (1 to many orders, 1 to many order lines) from several different companies will be sent in by email to an outlook email account (specified only for this purpose) with a .csv or excel formatted attachment at all times of the day and all days of the week. The flow will open the email and open the attachment It will load all PO lines to a temp table in a SQL database A comparison will be made between newly added PO lines and view or order lines for customer in SQL view by a concatenated field of Customer Num, PO Num, PO Line to Customer Num, PO Num, Order Dtl Line. Only create new orders and order line items in Epicor for each unique line. Total all orders and lines generated in file and send in report to customer email on file. If there is an error, send by email to IT or Sales contact by email. When process complete, clear temp table and rename email subject to add – complete Wait on next email to process orders. .', 'DesignProblem': '  Power Systems needs to import order information into Epicor. These orders will be delivered as CSV files attached to emails from a variety of addresses. Orders will be created, however updates will NOT be allowed. If duplicate data (i.e., A second copy of an order) is received, it should generate an error. After order information is processed, an email needs to be dispatched to either IT or the customer depending on success of the import.', 'DesignSolution': ' Order Import Service This will be an Windows Service that is configured to poll for new emails on a recurring schedule. The schedule will be configurable and support intervals as short as every minute. This service will check a specified mailbox and look for unread emails with CSV attachments. Emails without attachments, or with non-CSV attachments will be ignored. When a relevant email is located, the following logic will be executed: Attachment and source address will be collected from the email and passed to an Order Creator function.  Described in following section. This is an internal function within this service. It is described separately for the sake of clarity. If Order Creator is able to successfully import the file: Email(s) will be sent to the customer(s) associated with the resulting orders. The original email will then be deleted. If Order Creator fails to import the file:  An email will be dispatched to a static address for Power Systems’ IT department. This message will be a forwarded copy of the original email with details of the error appended. Original email will be marked as read and left in the mailbox. This service will have the following options which will be configurable by editing a ‘standard’ .NET-style XML configuration file. App Server URL  Server hosting the Epicor application Instance Epicor Instance where orders should be sent\nE.g., Test, Pilot, Production, etc Epicor User Epicor Password Polling Interval Interval between polls for new messages.  Denominated in seconds. Test Mode If the service is placed in Test Mode, emails will not be deleted after processing. Messages will be left in place and re-imported at the next polling event. This is intended to support iterative testing without requiring repetitive generation of new messages. \ni.e., Allows import logic to be tested repeatedly on the same message(s). Failure Email Address to notify when an import fails. BCC Email Optional. All emails generated by this service will be BCC’d to this address. SMTP Server SMTP Port SMTP User SMTP Password Expose Importer Webservice It this flag is set, the Order Importer function (described below) will be exposed as a web service. Note: This service will use NLog for logging. There will be an additional file to configure logging options in the standard NLog format. Details on NLog configuration can be found on the NLog website:\n  Order Importer This is a function within the service. It will be exposed as a webservice based on a configuration flag. This function will accept CSV data originating in attachments to emails parsed by this service. (CSV’s will be converted to a datatable or similar object before being passed to the function.) Note: This design and the associated quote assumes all CSV files will be in the same format. If multiple formats need to be supported, additional development time may be required. This function will review the Customer Number and PO Number to determine whether a corresponding sales order exists in the system. If the sales order exists, an error will be generated. Epicor will not be modified and the originating email will be forwarded to Power Systems’ IT department. If the order does not exist, it will be created. Lines will be added for each row within the CSV file. Upon successful creation of the order, an email will be dispatched to the default email address for the customer. The message will contain the following information for each order/line created: PO Number Sales Order Number Ship To Address Line Number Part Number Quantity  Unit Price Extended Price Total PO Price  This is the ‘final’ PO price, inclusive of all taxes, fees, discounts, etc that have been configured within Epicor.', 'DesignUnitTests': 'Test: Send email with CSV for new order\n Result: Order should be created in Epicor.

The API currently being used requires 3 calls and takes an unreasonable amount of time to comelete. Additionally, the current solution relies on a dedicated “Amazon Freight” button which users must be made aware of and trained on. They would prefer to have a single “Freight” function in Customer Shipment Entry that will generate the correct label without requiring special knowledge or steps by the user. Note: \nThe AT API requires “SellingParty” and “ShipFromParty” values to be provided. This design assums that Midwest will be able to provide these values or let Six S know where to retrieve them when development begins.', 'DesignSolution': ' Label Retrieval Six S will create an Epicor Function that connects to the Amazon Transportation API (documentation provided by Midwest) and retrieves a label for a given shipment. This function will take the following parameters: Pack number Current user’s workstation (Used to identify printer) The function will lookup the PO Number on the Sales Order associated with the shipment. It will then make a call to AT’s “CreateShippingLabelsRequest” web service. If the AT service returns an error, the message will be relayed to the end user. If a label is returned it will be printed on the default label printer associated with the specified workstation. This function will be used to replace the current logic used for printing Amazon labels. Customer Shipment Entry This screen will be modified to merge the functionality of the “Amazon Freight” button with the standard “Freight” function. Both buttons will be removed/hidden and a new custom “Freight” function will be added. When triggered, this function will perform the following steps: Review Ship Via to determine if the current pack is shipping via AT or an alternate method. If the pack is shipping via AT: The custom “Label Retrieval” function will be triggered to retrieve an AT shipping label. This label will be printed at the default label printer for the user’s workstation. The pack will be marked “Shipped”. Processing will complete. If the pack is shipping via a non-AT method: The standard Epicor freight logic will be triggered. Essentially, the new button will replicate the standard “Freight” button with the addition of the ability to properly generate and print labels for AT shipments.  Fulfillment Workbench This screen has an existing SMP button that generates shipments on the My Selections tab.  This function will be modified to also generate and print labels for any orders that are shipping via AT. If an order is shipping via AT, the following steps will be executed: The custom “Label Retrieval” function will be triggered to retrieve an AT shipping label. This label will be printed at the default label printer for the user’s workstation. The pack will be marked “Shipped”. Processing will proceed to the next order. Note: This function was developed quite some time ago. It may benefit from refactoring to bring the code inline with current best practices. If minor refactoring is needed, it will be done as part of this project. If more extensive refactoring is warranted, Six S will contact Midwest to discuss the issues that have been identified, time required to rectify and related decisions.', 'DesignUnitTests': 'Test: Click “Freight” on a pack shipping via AT\n Result: AT label should be retrieved and printed.\nTest: Click “Freight on a non-AT pack\n Result: Standard Epicor freighting logic should execute.'}

If duplicate data (i.e., A second copy of an order) is received, it should generate an error. After order information is processed, an email needs to be dispatched to either IT or the customer depending on success of the import.', 'DesignSolution': ' Order Import Service This will be an Windows Service that is configured to poll for new emails on a recurring schedule. The schedule will be configurable and support intervals as short as every minute. This service will check a specified mailbox and look for unread emails with CSV attachments. Emails without attachments, or with non-CSV attachments will be ignored. When a relevant email is located, the following logic will be executed: Attachment and source address will be collected from the email and passed to an Order Creator function.  Described in following section. This is an internal function within this service. It is described separately for the sake of clarity. If Order Creator is able to successfully import the file: Email(s) will be sent to the customer(s) associated with the resulting orders. The original email will then be deleted. If Order Creator fails to import the file:  An email will be dispatched to a static address for Power Systems’ IT department.

App Server URL  Server hosting the Epicor application Instance Epicor Instance where orders should be sent\nE.g., Test, Pilot, Production, etc Epicor User Epicor Password Polling Interval Interval between polls for new messages.  Denominated in seconds. Test Mode If the service is placed in Test Mode, emails will not be deleted after processing. Messages will be left in place and re-imported at the next polling event. This is intended to support iterative testing without requiring repetitive generation of new messages. \ni.e., Allows import logic to be tested repeatedly on the same message(s). Failure Email Address to notify when an import fails. BCC Email Optional. All emails generated by this service will be BCC’d to this address. SMTP Server SMTP Port SMTP User SMTP Password Expose Importer Webservice It this flag is set, the Order Importer function (described below) will be exposed as a web service. Note: This service will use NLog for logging. There will be an additional file to configure logging options in the standard NLog format. Details on NLog configuration can be found on the NLog website:\n  Order Importer This is a function within the service. It will be exposed as a webservice based on a configuration flag. This function will accept CSV data originating in attachments to emails parsed by this service. (CSV’s will be converted to a datatable or similar object before being passed to the function.) Note: This design and the associated quote assumes all CSV files will be in the same format. If multiple formats need to be supported, additional development time may be required. This function will review the Customer Number and PO Number to determine whether a corresponding sales order exists in the system. If the sales order exists, an error will be generated. Epicor will not be modified and the originating email will be forwarded to Power Systems’ IT department. If the order does not exist, it will be created. Lines will be added for each row within the CSV file. Upon successful creation of the order, an email will be dispatched to the default email address for the customer. The message will contain the following information for each order/line created: PO Number Sales Order Number Ship To Address Line Number Part Number Quantity  Unit Price Extended Price Total PO Price  This is the ‘final’ PO price, inclusive of all taxes, fees, discounts, etc that have been configured within Epicor.', 'DesignUnitTests': 'Test: Send email with CSV for new order\n Result: Order should be created in Epicor.

This label will be printed at the default label printer for the user’s workstation. The pack will be marked “Shipped”. Processing will complete. If the pack is shipping via a non-AT method: The standard Epicor freight logic will be triggered. Essentially, the new button will replicate the standard “Freight” button with the addition of the ability to properly generate and print labels for AT shipments.  Fulfillment Workbench This screen has an existing SMP button that generates shipments on the My Selections tab.  This function will be modified to also generate and print labels for any orders that are shipping via AT. If an order is shipping via AT, the following steps will be executed: The custom “Label Retrieval” function will be triggered to retrieve an AT shipping label. This label will be printed at the default label printer for the user’s workstation. The pack will be marked “Shipped”. Processing will proceed to the next order. Note: This function was developed quite some time ago. It may benefit from refactoring to bring the code inline with current best practices. If minor refactoring is needed, it will be done as part of this project. If more extensive refactoring is warranted, Six S will contact Midwest to discuss the issues that have been identified, time required to rectify and related decisions.', 'DesignUnitTests': 'Test: Click “Freight” on a pack shipping via AT\n Result: AT label should be retrieved and printed.\nTest: Click “Freight on a non-AT pack\n Result: Standard Epicor freighting logic should execute.'}

Do you have any 6S team members that are power users of Service Connect? We have several seats of Epicor Enterprise Edition Service Connect Run Time Only which means that we can run flows but we cannot create them. If we gave you requirements could a 6S team member create a flow for us to be able to incorporate in our instance to import orders from a .csv file either in a network folder or as an email is received to a specific inbox with a .csv attachment to be processed. There is some urgency to this request. Requirements:  I am requesting the fields from the Power Systems team right now so this might be delayed a bit but we need the following: PO lines (1 to many orders, 1 to many order lines) from several different companies will be sent in by email to an outlook email account (specified only for this purpose) with a .csv or excel formatted attachment at all times of the day and all days of the week. The flow will open the email and open the attachment It will load all PO lines to a temp table in a SQL database A comparison will be made between newly added PO lines and view or order lines for customer in SQL view by a concatenated field of Customer Num, PO Num, PO Line to Customer Num, PO Num, Order Dtl Line. Only create new orders and order line items in Epicor for each unique line. Total all orders and lines generated in file and send in report to customer email on file. If there is an error, send by email to IT or Sales contact by email. When process complete, clear temp table and rename email subject to add – complete Wait on next email to process orders. .-1', [-0.02822106145322323, -0.012948734685778618, -0.030671391636133194,

orders from our different businesses to our Epicor instance. Do you have any 6S team members that are power users of Service Connect? We have several seats of Epicor Enterprise Edition Service Connect Run Time Only which means that we can run flows but we cannot create them. If we gave you requirements could a 6S team member create a flow for us to be able to incorporate in our instance to import orders from a .csv file either in a network folder or as an email is received to a specific inbox with a .csv attachment to be processed. There is some urgency to this request. Requirements:  I am requesting the fields from the Power Systems team right now so this might be delayed a bit but we need the following: PO lines (1 to many orders, 1 to many order lines) from several different companies will be sent in by email to an outlook email account (specified only for this purpose) with a .csv or excel formatted attachment at all times of the day and all days of the week. The flow will open the email and open the attachment It will load all PO lines to a temp table in a SQL database A comparison will be made between newly added PO lines and view or order lines for customer in SQL view by a concatenated field of Customer Num, PO Num, PO Line to Customer Num, PO Num, Order Dtl Line. Only create new orders and order line items in Epicor for each unique line. Total all orders and lines generated in file and send in report to customer email on file. If there is an error, send by email to IT or Sales contact by email. When process complete, clear temp table and rename email subject to add – complete Wait on next email to process orders. .', 'ChunkNumber': 1})]

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added.

Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added.

Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added.

Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added.

Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

We will add a command button on the Customer Shipment Entry screen with the label “Generate Bill of Lading”.  The command button will only be enabled when the Customer Shipment Entry has been saved and the Pack has not shipped.    When the button is clicked, the system first looks for a linked Bill of Lading.   If one exists, it will be deleted.  The system then generates a new Bill of Lading.    The requirement is to automate the process of generating a Bill of Lading using the current Pack ID.  Once the Bill of Lading has been generated, a slide out panel should display with a success message and the new Bill of Lading ID.

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added. Report Qty 6.\tAdd the following: a.\tSerial Number: A field where users can scan or manually input the serial number. b.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal c.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal d.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal e.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. f.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox  7.\tHide the following: a.\tResource, Resource Name, Next Assembly, Next Opr Seq, Revision, PCID, Lot, Request Move, Attribute Set, Total Qty and UOM, Print Contents, Serial Numbers Button, Generate PCID Button, Next Lot Button, Co Parts Tab, Labor Equipment Tab, Inspection Data Button  8.\tMake the following Read Only: a.\tCurrent Qty and UOM b.\tJob c.\tAssembly d.\tOperation  9.\tAdd the following read only fields For the specific fields that need to display data from lower-level serial numbers (e.g., compressor serial, controller serial, evaporator serial, gateway serial), fetch the data by searching for matched serial numbers with the required part classes.  Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

When the button is clicked, the system first looks for a linked Bill of Lading.   If one exists, it will be deleted.  The system then generates a new Bill of Lading.    The requirement is to automate the process of generating a Bill of Lading using the current Pack ID.  Once the Bill of Lading has been generated, a slide out panel should display with a success message and the new Bill of Lading ID.

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added. Report Qty 6.\tAdd the following: a.\tSerial Number: A field where users can scan or manually input the serial number. b.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal c.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal d.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal e.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. f.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox  7.\tHide the following: a.\tResource, Resource Name, Next Assembly, Next Opr Seq, Revision, PCID, Lot, Request Move, Attribute Set, Total Qty and UOM, Print Contents, Serial Numbers Button, Generate PCID Button, Next Lot Button, Co Parts Tab, Labor Equipment Tab, Inspection Data Button  8.\tMake the following Read Only: a.\tCurrent Qty and UOM b.\tJob c.\tAssembly d.\tOperation  9.\tAdd the following read only fields For the specific fields that need to display data from lower-level serial numbers (e.g., compressor serial, controller serial, evaporator serial, gateway serial), fetch the data by searching for matched serial numbers with the required part classes.  Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added. Report Qty 6.\tAdd the following: a.\tSerial Number: A field where users can scan or manually input the serial number. b.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal c.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal d.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal e.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. f.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox  7.\tHide the following: a.\tResource, Resource Name, Next Assembly, Next Opr Seq, Revision, PCID, Lot, Request Move, Attribute Set, Total Qty and UOM, Print Contents, Serial Numbers Button, Generate PCID Button, Next Lot Button, Co Parts Tab, Labor Equipment Tab, Inspection Data Button  8.\tMake the following Read Only: a.\tCurrent Qty and UOM b.\tJob c.\tAssembly d.\tOperation  9.\tAdd the following read only fields For the specific fields that need to display data from lower-level serial numbers (e.g., compressor serial, controller serial, evaporator serial, gateway serial), fetch the data by searching for matched serial numbers with the required part classes.  Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

The requirement is to automate the process of generating a Bill of Lading using the current Pack ID.  Once the Bill of Lading has been generated, a slide out panel should display with a success message and the new Bill of Lading ID.

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'DesignProblem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'DesignSolution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed.

Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen.

The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'DesignUnitTests': ''}

This includes product details, quantities, prices, and any other relevant information that will be included in the sales order.\n\n3. **Converting the Quote**: Use the 'Convert to Sales Order' function or a similar feature within Kinetic to initiate the conversion of the quote into a sales order. This step may involve selecting an option such as 'Create Sales Order from Quote' or using a convert function within the quotes module.\n\n4. **Creating Order Lines**: If necessary, break down the quoted items into individual order lines. Each line should have its own specifications, pricing, and any other required details.\n\n5. **Confirming the Sales Order**: After the quote has been converted and all order lines are created, you will need to confirm the details of the new sales order. This may involve reviewing product information, delivery details, and other terms of the sale.\n\n6. **Saving the Sales Order**: Once all details are confirmed and you are satisfied with the information, save the new sales order in the system. This action typically finalizes the conversion process and may initiate the order fulfillment process.\n\n7. **Order Fulfillment**: After the sales order is saved, Kinetic will likely have a set of processes for fulfilling the order. This could include inventory checks, shipping arrangements, and invoicing.\n\n8. **Finalization**: To finalize the creation of an order line from a quote, after you have filled in the details and made any necessary changes, you would select 'OK' to confirm inside the 'Get Quote Line For Order' panel, and then complete the sales order.\n\nThroughout this process, it's important to ensure that each step is completed accurately to prevent any issues with the order. If the CRM module is enabled in Kinetic, converting a quote to a sales order might also involve marking the quote as won, which could automatically generate an order.\n\nPlease note that the exact steps and terminology may vary depending on the version of Kinetic you are using and any customizations that have been made to your system. If you require more detailed instructions, including screenshots or specific button locations, you should refer to the sales order processing section of the Kinetic user guide or reach out to your system administrator for assistance."}

2023-11-23 20:01:23,794 - services.omnaiService - DEBUG - Response: {'response': "Yes, in C#, you can use the `async` and `await` keywords to tell the code to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete before continuing execution. This is useful when you need to make calls that may take some time to complete, such as web service calls, without blocking the main thread and freezing the user interface.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might use `async` and `await` in a function:\n\n```csharp\nprivate async Task MyAsyncFunction()\n{\n    // This line will start the operation and then immediately return control to the caller\n    var result = await SomeLongRunningOperationAsync();\n\n    // The following lines of code will not execute until SomeLongRunningOperationAsync has completed\n    // You can work with the result here\n    ProcessResult(result);\n}\n\nprivate async Task<ResultType> SomeLongRunningOperationAsync()\n{\n    // Simulate a long-running operation\n    await Task.Delay(2000); // Waits for 2 seconds asynchronously\n    return new ResultType(); // Replace with actual operation and result\n}\n\nprivate void ProcessResult(ResultType result)\n{\n    // Process the result here\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyAsyncFunction` is an asynchronous method that calls another asynchronous method `SomeLongRunningOperationAsync` using `await`. The `await` keyword causes the execution of `MyAsyncFunction` to pause until `SomeLongRunningOperationAsync` completes, at which point it resumes with the result.\n\nRemember to handle exceptions that may occur during asynchronous operations and consider the use of `ConfigureAwait(false)` if you don't need to resume on the original synchronization context (e.g., in a library code that doesn't interact with the UI)."}

For further reference, this proposal pertains to the Opportunity Quote Entry and the Quote Engineering Entry. Opp/Quote Entry will be the reference to both.  \n When adding a Purchased Part on an Opp/Quote, the Purchase Direct checkbox must be checked in order to add a Supplier and/or a purchase price to the Part.  Currently, the addition of a Purchase Price, Supplier Price List or Supplier RFQ Needed, Supplier ID, Purchase Point, Min Total Cost, Lead Time,  or Purchasing Comments, require the Purchase Direct checkbox to  be checked.  Min Quantity Lot Charge, Min Qty, and multiple (package size) are sometimes designated in a Supplier Quote. These should be displayed and factored into the Opp/Quote. A last received date should be added next to the unit cost of each material.    A box should be added next to the lead time box that populates the Max Lead Time value from the materials added to the line BOM.          The Worksheet slots need modification to allow for the viewing of the individual costs, plus the extended as already shown. The extended would be the product of the quantity quoted multiplied by the individual costs extended and then extended against the Profit or Markup goal.    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\tExtend these boxes too  The User should be able to Print Preview without the Opp/Quote marked “Quoted” (checkbox) At the Labor and Overhead – the amounts are to be displayed as to reflect Setup and Labor Extended. The amounts should reflect individual (per EA) and the extended as it appears now.    Add a date field between Due Date and Days Open that is called “Commit Date”.', 'Problem': '  Atron needs various changes to the Opportunity Quote Entry screen as well as some supporting BPMs. Individual items are detailed in the following section.', 'Solution': ' Purchase Direct  Atron needs to enable “Purchase Direct” on quotes as it enables various fields that allow them to capture needed data. However, they do NOT wish the resulting jobs to be marked “Purchase Direct”. A BPM will be added that defaults the “Purchase Direct” field to “True” for all quote materials. A new “Retain Purchase Direct” checkbox will be added to the Order Job Wizard. This box will be bound to a CallContext field.  If the checkbox is unchecked, a BPM will be triggered that clears the “Purchase Direct” field for all materials on the resulting job. If the checkbox is checked, the BPM will not be triggered and all fields will be populated according to the standard business logic.  Quote Header “Commit Date” field will be added to the quote header. This will be a manually entered date field.  Quote Lines “Max Material Lead Time” field will be added. This integer field will be a read only value auto-populated by a BPM. It will be calculated be reviewing the lead time on all quote materials and taking the largest value.  When materials are added or removed, or if their lead times are changed, this value will be re-calculated. Quote Materials / Pricing “Last Received” date will be added. This will be a read-only field, auto-populated with the date of the most recent PO receipt for this part. A second BPM will update this value when a quote is marked “Engineered”. A red/green shape (Like those for “Engineered”, “Quoted” and other statuses) will be added. This shape will be red if the “Last Received” date is more than 30 days in the past. When a quote is marked “Engineered” a warning will be displayed to the user if any materials have: A “Last Received” date more than 30 days in the past. A $0 cost. Exception: Materials with a quantity of zero will not trigger these warnings. The warning message will list the specific part numbers with outdated values. The following fields will be added as read-only, reference values. They will show summary values for the entire Site. A BAQ dataview will be used to retrieve these values. On Hand Allocated Quantity On Order Quantity – i.e., Total number of parts present on open, unrecieved PO lines/releases.  Quote Worksheet – Printed / SSRS An “Old Pricing” field will be added for each material. It will be a checkbox that is marked “true” for any material with a “Last Received” date more than 30 days in the past.  Quote Worksheet – On-screen Tab  The existing versions of the fields listed below show extended values by default. (i.e., Total value for the entire quoted quantity) Additional fields will be added, adjacent to the existing fields, to show the per-part values. These will be calculated by dividing the standard values by the line quantity.

2023-11-30 13:34:27,395 - services.caseService - INFO - texts_and_types for case 2167: {'Need': ' When trying to figure out how to handle Backorders, we came across an issue with our Illustrated packing list: When a shipment has multiple lines for one part number, such as in the case of pulling from multiple bins, the illustrated packing list will only print one line for that part with one quantity. We intended for it to display this way, but we need that quantity to be the sum of all lines with that part number.   This leads me to my next request: Would your team be able to add “backordered” parts into our Illustrated Packing List custom form? During this development period, could they also fix the issue with quantities not being added up on the form?  I can see backorders being a bit difficult to handle, especially when you’re dealing with orders that have multiple releases. My thinking, is that a form could be designed that checks for all releases on a sales order with the same ship to and ship date, and populates lines on the Packing List with the missing quantities for those parts. A backorder to us, would simply be something that is supposed to be shipped, but isn’t on that shipment. I’m shocked Epicor doesn’t do this by default, but it’s something we have a dire need for, as I found out we’ve been internally editing every single packing slip before sending them out.', 'Problem': '  WWR needs two changes to their existing Illustrated Packing Slip: Parts present on multiple shipment lines are not being represented correctly. Currently the packing slip only shows the quantity being shipped on a single line. It should display the total quantity of the part being shipped. \ni.e., Packing Slip should display the total quantity across all lines for each part being shipped. Backorder quantities are not currently displayed. Back order quantities are parts that are not on the current packing slip or any previous shipment for the current order. This should be displayed in a clearly labeled “Back Order” section that is clearly differentiated from the parts being shipped. Back orders should only be displayed for releases that are going to the same shipto as the current shipment.\n(WWR often has orders with releases going to multiple destinations.)', 'Solution': ' Six S will modify WWRs existing Illustrated Packing Slip to make the following changes: Part quantities will be adjusted to show the total quantity being shipped on the current pack. (Rather than a line-specific quantity.) A “Back Order” section will be added to the packing slip which displays any un-shipped parts for the related order. Only backorders with the same destination as the current shipment will be displayed.\ni.e., Recipients should not see information on backorders destined for other locations.', 'Components': 'Pack Slip, Report, Style to be modified'}

They would like to have approvers (Sales VP, CFO) receive an approval request via Slack and email when discount approvals are needed on a quote. Specific recipients will depend on the discount amount of the Product Line AND Total Quote Dollar Amounts. Workforce functionality within Kinetic will be leveraged to define approvers. They would like approvers to be able to approve, deny, or change the discount level via Slack and email. i.e., They should not have to log into Epicor.  Only quotes containing parts from the following groups will be subject to this logic: Rental - Rental Sales Units - Robot Units Sales Note: \nThe proposed solution utilizes the Epicor Automation Studio. There is a licensing cost associated with this module.  Six S recommends the use of Automation Studio rather than custom code as it will provide a more robust, reliable solution in this case. Automation Studio’s connections to Outlook/Gmail/email and Slack are constantly kept up to date. This will prevent the need for Six S to revisit this solution every time APIs or security requirements change in one of the connected services.', 'Solution': ' Six S will build the following components to implement the functionality described above: Role Code Maintenance A new field will be added to this screen: Quote Discount Approval Level  This field will contain a percentage amount. It will identify the level of discount that requires approval from someone with this role code.\ne.g., If the “VP of Sales” role is set to 8%, all quotes with a discount of 8% or higher will require approval by someone with the “VP of Sales” role. Quote Value Approval Level This field will contain a dollar amount. It will identify the level of discount that requires approval from someone with this role code.\ne.g., If the “CFO” role is set to $500,000, all quotes with a value of $500,000 or higher will require approval by someone with the “CFO” role.    Opportunity / Quote Entry A new “Approvals” grid will be added to the screen. This grid will show all approvals, either pending or completed, for the current quote. This grid will be backed by a UD table. (Specific table to be chosen based on availability when development begins.) There will be one row in the table for each level of approval that is required.\ne.g., A quote with a 30% discount would have one row for the VP of Sales’s approval, and another row for the CFO’s approval. Rows in this grid will ONLY be modifiable by users with the relevant Role Code. Grid will have the following columns: Req Role Indicates the role that is required to perform this approval. Approved Checkbox indicating an approval was received. Response Response, once received. The following options are possible: Approved Denied Adjusted Username Will store the username of the specific person who approved/denied this record. Response Method Track the source of the user’s response. i.e. Slack vs Email. This data will be used to determine how responses should be relayed to the quote creator. \ne.g., If a user approves a quote via Slack, the quote creator will be notified via Slack. BPMs Approval Enforcer This BPM will prevent a quote from being marked as “Quoted” if approvals are outstanding or a discount has been denied.   Approval Calculator This is a BPM backed by a Function that will calculate the required approvals anytime the discount or overall value is changed on a quote. \n This BPM will be triggered by the clicking of a new “Ready For Approval” checkbox that will be added to the quote header table and made visible within Opportunity Quote Entry. The value on the quote header will be used to determine the Dollar Value criteria.   The discount percentage will be determined based on the total value of line item(s) with the following Product Groups: Rental - Rental Sales  Units - Robot Units Sales  Calculation: 100 – ((Discounted Line Value / Original Line Value) * 100) e.g., \tOriginal line value of $1,000, discounted to $800: 100 – ((800 / 1000) * 100 = 20% Discount  A UD record will be created for each required approval. These records will appear in the Opportunity / Quote Entry screen. If the value or discount has been lowered, any approval record that is no longer needed will be removed. However, any records that have already been approved will be retained. If the discount or value is raised, all records will be recreated/reset and require new approval regardless of previous state. Additionally, the “Ready For Approval” checkbox on the quote header will be cleared.  Approval Requester This is a BPM backed by functions that will send Slack and email messages requesting approval for a specified quote. A message will be dispatched to all Work Force entries that have the required Role Code(s).  e.g., If a quote requires approval from both “VP of Sales” and “CFO”, all users assigned to those role codes will be messaged. This function will be triggered anytime a new approval record is created, or an existing approval is rescinded.  Messages will list the quote amount, customer, and discount percentage. A PDF copy of the quote will be included with the messages. Users will be able to respond with one of the defined options. (Approve, Deny, Adjust)  These emails will be sent with a dedicated “Reply To” address that will be monitored by a function described below. Note:\nAvidBots will need to configure and provide this account to Six S. This should be a new email account, dedicated to this functionality.   Approval Updater - Slack This functionality will be provided by the Approval Bot that is provided by Slack. This is a bot that will request users approve/deny a specified record and then inform the requesting system (i.e. Epicor) of their response. A Function within Epicor will receive the approval/denial/adjustment and update the quote accordingly. Communication between Slack and Epicor will be provided by Epicor Automation Studio. \nNote: Automation studio is an Epicor module with an associated licensing cost.  Approval Updater - Email This is a functionality will be provided by the Gmail integration available within Automation Studio.  The integration will log into the email account that is designated as the “Reply To” for the approval request emails. The email body will include instructions for the user to reply with specific terms and numbers. (Detailed below) It will then look for any replies to the approval request emails. When replies are found, it will attempt to parse the message and relay the response to Epicor. A Function within Epicor will receive the approval/denial and update the quote accordingly. Quote will be identified by locating a string in the format “Quote: ####” within the subject line. The email address that sent the reply will be used to identify the appropriate Work Force / Role Code. Response will be determined by reviewing the body of the email. Valid responses: Approval Terms Approve Approved Yes OK Denial Terms Deny Denied No Adjust Adjust Change Note: This option will be dependent on a percentage in the format ##% being identified in the email body. If a specific percentage cannot be identified, no adjustment will be performed. Avidbots would like the reply from the Approver, whether email or Slack to also go to the Quote Creator. This will be handled by the Quote Approval Function, detailed below.   Quote Approval Function This is a Function that will be created within Epicor. This will provide a REST endpoint which Automation Studio can use to submit user responses to Epicor. Automation Studio will contact this function anytime a quote is approved or denied. The Function will then approve/deny/adjust the quote in accordance with the user’s response.  Discount adjustments will only be applied to lines of product groups: Rental - Rental Sales  Units - Robot Units Sales   The specified discount percentage will be applied to all relevant lines, regardless of their initial discount level. When all required approvals have been received, the quote will automatically be marked “Quoted”. If the quote has been closed, deleted, or otherwise cannot be updated, a message will be sent to the approver informing them of the error.', 'Components': 'Test, Test, Test'}

These Operations are to be established in sequencing denoting critical Operations as Milestones and sub-operations would “roll-up” to the Milestone Operation. The sub-Operations cycle times would roll-up to the Milestone Operation cycle time and the Milestone operation would be the Operation reported to – not the sub-Operations. Reporting to the Milestone Operation will complete the sub-Operations.  If a partial amount of the Milestone Operation is reported through the course of the process, the sub-operations would reflect the reporting accordingly. The current ATRON Group environment has this type of setup and enables ATRON to manage and track small amounts of requirements of manufacture. The desire to have critical path Operations established as Milestones and designated as such. The sub-Operations would roll-up to the total cycle time of that Milestone Operation. The sub-Operation rates (standards – pcs/hr./, minutes/hr., fixed hours, etc.) will be the same as the Milestone Operation. As time, or quantity is reported to the Milestone Operation(s) the sub-Operations would be decremented accordingly.', 'Problem': '  ATRON would like to create quotes with a large number of similar operations.

It will be accompanied by BPMs to trigger execution of the function when a job is created via the Order Job Wizard or the Get Details is used within Job Entry to pull Quote BOM information into a job. Operations will be grouped by **NEEDS CLARIFICATION** For each group of operations, they will be rolled us as follows: The “parent” operation will remain in the BOM. All other operations will be removed. The Qty/Parent for the remaining operation will be the total of this operation and all child operations. E.g., If there are four operations, each with a Qty/Parent of 10, the rolled-up quantity would be 40. The Production Standard will be calculated by calculating estimated time for each operation, summing it and dividing by the total quantity to be produced. For example: Operation 1: Qty/Parent = 10, Production Std = 1 Hrs/Piece, Total Time = 10 Operation 2: Qty/Parent = 5, Production Std = 1.2 Hrs/Piece, Total Time = 6 Operation 3: Qty/Parent = 15, Production Std = 2 Hrs/Piece, Total Time = 30 Operation 4: Qty/Parent = 20, Production Std = .25 Hrs/Piece, Total Time = 4 Total Qty: 40 Total Time: 50 Hours Rolled up Prod Std: .8 Hrs/Piece Setup Hours will be the summed value of all rolled up operations.', 'Components': 'Operation Roll Up, Function, Roll up operations on a given job., Order Job Wizard, BPM, Trigger Roll Up Function, Get Details, BPM, Trigger Roll Up Function'}

These discounts need to be properly reflected within EDI files.', 'Problem': '  OMC requires a custom discount calculation algorithm for their Home Depot orders. They have provided examples of Packing Slips and EDI files that show the required discount. They have also provided the Excel sheet that is currently used to calculate the discount. Six S will use this spreadsheet as the basis for the newly created discount logic.', 'Solution': ' Six S will add a BPM to the AR Invoice business object within Epicor to implement a custom discount calculation. This calculation will ONLY be applied to orders for Home Depot. Home Depot’s customer ID will be a hardcoded condition within the BPM. The customer ID will be placed in a condition widget so that it is easily maintainable without the need to edit or understand C#. This logic will override / supersede all other standard Epicor discount logic. Calculated discounts will be placed in the standard discount fields on the InvcDtl table. (i.e., Discount, DocDiscount, DiscountPercent)   This BPM will be triggered when the “Get Shipments” function is activated, and the discounts will be immediately calculated for the resulting invoices.  i.e., Invoices will be created with the correct discounts and no further action will be required by the user. This logic will execute for all Home Depot invoices regardless of the originating pack or sales order. If multiple invoices are created for a single order, the discount will calculate for all invoices. The resulting discount value will be placed in the standard discount fields. This will cause the discount to be reflected on 810 EDI files, and other documents without any further work. That being said, Six S will specifically confirm that the calculated discounts are being properly reflected in outgoing EDI files. Should any issues be discovered, they will be addressed. Discount calculation rules: E210 Discount = (Order Subtotal – I170 Discount Amount – C300 Discount Amount) * .0189 Note: \nThis discount must be calculated using the percentage above. Rounding it to .019 or other values will NOT yield acceptable results. This is a non-negotiable issue with Home Depot.', 'Components': ''}

However, the e-mail recipients are different depending on the task set and/or task. Avidbots would like to have the e-mails sent upon completion of certain tasks/task set combination. In addition, would like different templates depending on the defined task/task set combination (out of the box functionality does not allow this). In addition, these e-mails need to have dynamic fields that would be populated based on certain field values. Although a full breakdown of the list is still required, for example they would like the Quote # and Customer Name and Order Number (where applicable) to be in the notification e-mail (re: not a generic e-mail but an actual sentence that would say “Quote 123 for Customer X has been converted to Order 234”', 'Problem': '  AvidBots would like the ability to send emails to specific addresses when specific task/taskset combinations are completed.

This will be accomplished through the following:  Task Set Maintenance Customization  A new layer will be created for the Task Set Maintenance screen. An “Email on Completion” text field will be added to the “Task Set Maintenance > Milestones > Detail” tab that will allow the user to enter a “;” separated list of email addresses that should receive an email upon completion of that specific milestone on that specific task set. This field will be mapped to: “TaskSDtl.EmailList_c” Task Completion BPM/Function A bpm will be added that fires upon a task being completed. This BPM will check to see if there are any email addresses in the aforementioned list for the task/taskset in question and then send an email to those recipients based on the following:  BPM Condition Statement: The BPM will check a series of condition statements to see if the current task set/ task ID matches any of these conditions. If so, the email template will be selected based on the condition matched. This means that for every “unique” email template a series of conditions will need to be identified by Avidbots.  No Conditions Matched: If there is an email listed and there are no matching conditions in the BPM then a standard template will be used. Notes:  All development will be done in the Kinetic UI Condition statements, matching email templates and a standard email template will need to be provided by AvidBots.  This design doc and quote assumes there are less than 10 unique combinations/conditions/templates to be created. If more than 10 are needed, additional time will need to be requested.  The dynamic fields in the templates IE Order Num, QuoteNum, Customer Name etc. must have some direct path to the task being completed.

Notes:  All customizations will be completed in the Kinetic UI This design has deviated slightly from the original request in that we have to add a separate field to capture the barcode scan rather than including “TABS” in the barcode itself.

It sounds like it would be Six S building out the BPMs and then doing testing – not sure if you’ll need much from my team other than coordinating timing… specifically around our UoM change to eaches. Depending how they’re writing the calculations and scripting – that could come into play. As well, I had a few questions / flags about the logic in her concept document – just making sure some of these things are being considered: \xa0 Her solution concept wasn’t clear, but she said they would reference a ‘number of pieces per pallet’ in the part master. Not sure if that’s referencing the ‘per container’ field or looking to see if ‘PA’ or ‘PL’ are active UoM codes for the part and following that multiplier… but either way you may end up with a lot of pallet charges for non-returnable-palleted products (one of many e.g.: 138286 one40two bench) – per container is ‘1’ and has the ‘PA’ UoM of 1 EA = 1PA. Unless I’m mistaken, that is custom packaged and not on a returnable pallet. Do you know if there was other logic looks to see if the product is sold in pallets to begin with (ie it wouldn’t assign a pallet to a line for something that is custom packaged, like site furnishings or many of our large wetcast products?) Based on the current concept, there may be a LOT of data cleanup needed…  For the actual calculation (number of pallets) – again, is it looking to the ‘per container’ field, or the UoM Multiple? If UoM Multiple, then be aware that we have both PA and PL (and BU) in active use – without much consistency (some have all, some have only 1 or 2). We are hoping to clean that up to JUST “PL” moving forward, but for this summer that will only be done on Hess / Vena parts. And if it’s the ‘per container’ field, I’m not sure we’d want to ‘0’ out parts not on a returnable pallet (see #1 above), as that is still useful for custom packaged products for other reasons.  Was a separate logic discussed for handling row packaging? In simple situations the rounding up would be fine (e.g. 1 pallet plus 1 row of holland would round to 2 pallets for the line – no worries). But in a case where there are multiple lines with row qty’s, my understanding is that they will combine rows of different parts from different lines onto a single pallet if they’re able, for shipping. e.g. 1 pallet plus 1 row of holland, and 1 pallet plus 1 row of stackstone on the same order… we would probably ship on 3 pallets (2 rows packaged onto a single pallet). Assuming the rounding is per line, the calculation could give 4 pallets on the Misc. charge. Rounding for the whole order (not per line) could also have its own challenges.  \xa0 Anyway. I realize this isn’t a full development design document, and I’m sure Monique can figure out some solutions here. Just wanted to raise the few questions / flags I had early on before you’re too far down the path – to make sure we were considering a more realistic scope for this project. Explain your need here.', 'Problem': '  Barkman ships many products on specially created heavy-duty pallets. As these pallets are substantially more expensive than standard pallets, they encourage customers to return them as much as possible. In order to facilitate this, they charge a pallet fee to customers that is refunded upon return of the pallets. Currently, they are listing the pallets as parts on orders. In the future, they would like the pallet charge to be represented by a Miscellaneous Charge.  A new Miscellaneous Charge will be created and have a new UD field populated to carry the “Per Pallet Fee” value. This value will be multiplied by the total number of pallets to determine the final Pallet Fee. The “Parts Per Container” field will be used to calculate the number of pallets required by a given order/shipment. Pallet fees are generally calculated at time of shipment. But time-of-order calculation is also needed to support customers that pre-pay their orders. All calculated values should allow for override by users in exceptional scenarios. Pallet Fees should be displayed on both the Sales Order Acknowledgement and Invoice forms.', 'Solution': ' Pallet Fee Calculation Functions Fee Calculator Six S will create a function to calculate the Pallet Fee for a given order, shipment, or other record. V3 Change:\nFunction accepts a pallet count as an optional parameter. This function will take a list of parts with their associated quantity, UOM, and manually specified pallet count as input. This will allow the same function to be used for any given group of parts. \nE.g., Orders, shipments, partial shipments, etc. The function will look up the Parts Per Container value for each specified part. The part quantity will be divided by the container quantity and rounded up to a whole number to determine the number of pallets required. Container Quantities are denominated in each’s. If the input UOM for this function (i.e., the UOM on the order, shipment, etc) is not in each’s, it will be converted to each in order to accurately calculate the number of required pallets. This function should calculate the same Pallet Fee regardless of the UOM the parts are denominated in. This value will then be multiplied by the “Pallet Multiplier” value for the field. (Values of 0 will be ignored.) Example: Part Number: Product123\nQuantity: 100\nContainer Qty: 16\nPallet Multiplier: 3 Pallets need: 100 / 16 = 6.25 \nRounded value: 7 Multiplied: 7 * 3 = 21 Final Pallet Count: 21 V3 Change:\nThis logic will be bypassed if a pallet quantity was supplied to the function. (i.e., a value other than zero) If a pallet quantity was supplied it will be used in lieu of a calculated value. This value will be multiplied by a “Per Pallet Fee” located on the new Miscellaneous Charge to determine the total Pallet Fee. Total Pallet Fee will be returned by the function.  Order Fee Calculator This function will take an order number as an input. It will collect a list of all parts present on the specified order and their corresponding quantities.  Note:\nBarkman regularly uses varying UOMs on orders. It is important that this logic account for this and convert quantities to the base UOM before any further logic takes place. This list will be submitted to the Fee Calculator function (described above) to determine the Pallet Fee for the specified order.  Shipment Fee Calculator This function will take a packing slip number as an input. It will collect a list of all parts present on the specified pack, their corresponding quantities and any manually specified pallet counts.  This list will be submitted to the Fee Calculator function (described above) to determine the Pallet Fee and number of pallets required for the specified pack. V3 Change:\nThe number of required pallets will be stored individually in a UD field on each line of the shipment. This will facilitate accurate billing during the invoicing process and allow users to override the pallet count if/when needed.  Invoice Fee Calculator This function will take an invoice number as an input. It will collect a list of all parts present on the specified invoice, their corresponding quantities and any manually specified pallet counts.  This list will be submitted to the Fee Calculator function (described above) to determine the Pallet Fee and number of pallets required for each invoice line. The number of required pallets will be stored individually in a UD field on each line of the invoice. This will facilitate accurate billing during the invoicing process and allow users to override the pallet count if/when needed. The function will then create a miscellaneous charge on each invoice line to represent the calculated pallet fee if it does not already exist. If a miscellaneous charge exists, but has an incorrect value, it will be deleted and replaced by a charge of the correct value.  Order Entry Six S will customize the Order Entry process to display Pallet Fees as a reference value. This value will be visible, but not included in the actual order total. It is essentially a “preview” of the charges that will be generated during the shipping process. A “Lock Pallet Fee” checkbox will accompany this field. If this field is checked, pallet fee values will no longer be calculated. This is intended to support cases where users would like to enter an ‘ad hoc’ value for the fee. \nThis checkbox will default to an unchecked status and remain so unless it is manually checked by a user. A new UD field “PalletFee_c” will be added to the OrderHed table. This field will be made visible in: Order Entry Sales Order Acknowledgement When an order is saved (either manually or automatically) a BPM will trigger the “Order Fee Calculator” function and update the Pallet Fee field with the resulting value. Note: Counter sales are exempt from this logic. No values should be calculated for these orders. Though users can enter manual pallet fees if needed. If a user has already populated a custom value in the Pallet Fee field, they will receive a pop-up message asking them to confirm that they want to overwrite this value with the calculated value. \n\nThis message should only be displayed when a user has manually set the “Lock Pallet Fee” checkbox and the calculated fee is different from the value they’ve set V4 Change: Change the pop-up message logic in Order Entry to ONLY appear when the custom lock fee box is checked on the order header. Otherwise, just keep re-calculating the pallet fee without prompting.  Based on the following feedback:\n  Sales Order Acknowledgement This report will be modified to display the Pallet Fee in the “Order Total” section. \ni.e., The lower right area where taxes, discounts, miscellaneous charges, etc are broken down. This value will be rolled into the displayed total value for the order. This will include applying any relevant taxes to the pallet fee. These changes will be made to Barkman’s existing customized Order Acknowledgement. \nStyle name: “Barkman Sales Order” Value will be displayed in a format showing both the per-pallet fee and the total amount.  E.g., Pallet Fee: ($35) x 10 = $350.00 Note: \nThis is only required for the Order Ack and not the Packing Slip or subsequent documents. These fees will become Miscellaneous Charges at time of shipping and Epicor’s standard functionality will display them properly.  Invoice  This report will be modified to display the Pallet Fee in the “Invoice Total” section. \ni.e., The lower right area where taxes, discounts, miscellaneous charges, etc are broken down. This value will be rolled into the displayed total value for the order. This will include applying any relevant taxes to the pallet fee. These changes will be made to Barkman’s existing customized AR Invoice(s). \nStyle names: “Barkman AR Invoice Form” / “Barkman AR Invoice Form – Email” Value will be displayed in a format showing both the per-pallet fee and the total amount.  E.g., Pallet Fee: ($35) x 10 = $350.00 V3 Change:\nIndividual invoice lines will also display details of their associated pallet fee.  Customer Shipment Entry When a shipment is marked Ready To Invoice (i.e. Shipped) a BPM will be executed to trigger the “Shipment Fee Calculator” function.  V3 Change:\nA BPM will also trigger this function anytime a user manually changes the number of pallets required for a given line. (i.e., Anytime they edit the corresponding UD field.) If the user has already created a Miscellaneous Charge for a pallet fee, they will be prompted to confirm that they would like to overwrite this with the calculated value. If there is not an existing Miscellaneous Charge for a pallet fee, a message in the following format will be displayed to the user: "## of pallets will be added to the pallet fee charge. Does this match the quantity shipped?" Users will have the option to reply “yes” or “no”.  If the user responds “yes”: A new Miscellaneous Charge will be added for the calculated value.  Each line of the pack will be populated with the number of pallets required. The pack will be marked as shipped. Processing will continue per the default logic. If the user responds “no”: The pack will not be marked as shipped. Each line of the pack will be populated with the number of pallets required. User will have the ability to adjust quantity, create a manual fee or otherwise modify the pack.  After modifying the pack, they can attempt to mark it as shipped again and this logic will repeat based on the current status of the pack.  Invoice Entry A “Pallets Required” field will be added to the invoice line. A BPM will auto-populate this value with the value of the corresponding shipment line. When this value is changed either manually or via BPM, a BPM will trigger the Invoice Fee Calculator function to determine the correct pallet fee for the line.  Part Entry A new “Pallet Fees Applicable” checkbox will be created. This will be used to indicate parts that are subject to the pallet feel logic described above. Parts that do not have this field checked will be ignored by all logic related to this solution.  A “Pallet Multiplier” field will be added. This is an integer field that will be used to multiply the number of pallets required by this part. e.g., This part is a kit with multiple components and 1 “Each” may constitute several pallets.', 'Components': 'Sales Order Acknowledgement, Report, Display “Pallet Fee” field, Invoice Entry, Customization, Add “Pallets Required” field, Order Entry, BPM, Trigger update of pallet fees, Pallet Fee Calculator, Function, Calculate Pallet Fee, Shipment Fee Calculator, Function, Calculate pallet fee for shipments, Invoice, Report, Display “Pallet Fee” field, Order Entry, Customization, Display “Pallet Fee” field, Customer Shipment Entry, Customization, Add “Pallets Required” field, Order Fee Calculator, Function, Calculate pallet fee for sales orders, Invoice Entry, BPM, Calculate and adjust misc charges.'}

Rather than transmitting summary level information and performing journal entries, the integration should be creating fully detailed invoices on both the AR and AP side. These invoices should be linked so that individual client payments and other disbursements can be accurately tracked and audited. Payroll Solutions needs Six S to provide REST API endpoints so that information can be provided with the required level of detail. In addition to the invoice creation, Payroll Solutions would also like to transmit payment information into Epicor.', 'Solution': ' AR Invoices Six S will create an Epicor Function(s) that provide a REST endpoint that can be used to transmit Invoices into the system. The endpoint will accept a JSON dataset containing the entire invoice, both the header and associated lines. Each invoice line will include a Due Date that will be used on the corresponding AP Invoice. (Described below.) Header Fields: Invoice Number Epicor to generate and return Company Customer ID Currency  Exchange Rate This is the exchange rate between the invoice currency and Payroll Solution’s base system currency. If an exchange rate is not specified, the current system-wide exchange rate will be used. Line Fields: Part Quantity Unit Price Due Date This value will NOT affect the created AR Invoices. However, it will be stored in a UD field for reference purposes.  This field will be used as the Due Date on the corresponding AP Invoice. The resulting invoice number will be returned from this function, along with the invoice numbers of any corresponding AP invoices. It is expected that one invoice will be transmitted per client, per payroll. e.g., If 10 payrolls are being processed for 10 clients, 10 invoices will be received in Epicor. Invoices will have individual lines for each liability. \ne.g., Net pay, taxes, fees, etc Invoices will be posted immediately upon creation.  AP Invoices (aka Remittances) These invoices will represent Payroll Solutions’ various remittances to tax authorities and the payments to clients to fulfill their payroll. These invoices will be created automatically when an AR Invoice is created via the above-described AR Invoice endpoint. These will be Miscellaneous Invoices. Each invoice and each of their lines will be associated with a corresponding AR Invoice. It is expected that each invoice will have an individual line to break down payments on a per-supplier basis. e.g., One AR Invoice might contain three remittances. This will result in the creation of three AP invoices, one for each of the remittances. The supplier for each invoice will be determined by reviewing the associated part(s). It is expected that each part will be configured with one, and only one, Approved Supplier.  Invoices will only be created for parts that have the “Link To AP” checkbox filled. Invoices will be posted immediately upon creation.  Parts A “Link To AP” checkbox will be added to the part screen to indicate parts that require a corresponding AP invoice be created when an AR Invoice is created via the integration.  Payments Six S will create an Epicor Function(s) that provides a REST endpoint that can be used to transmit Invoice Payments into the system. The endpoint will accept a JSON dataset containing the payment information for a given invoice. If multiple invoices are being paid or multiple payments are being applied to a single invoice, multiple calls should be made to the API. Fields: Company Customer ID Invoice Number Invoice to be paid If an invoice number is not specified, a deposit payment will be made to the customer’s account. Apply Date Payment Amount Currency Exchange Rate  This should be the exchange rate between the payment currency and Payroll Solution’s base Kinetic currency. If an exchange rate is not specified, the current system-wide exchange rate will be used. A Cash Receipt will be created in Epicor for each payment that is submitted. These Cash Receipts will be posted immediately upon creation. Note: \nPrepayments (i.e., deposits) are expected to be applied manually. This endpoint will apply prepayments to the customer’s account, but it will NOT apply them to individual invoices.   Customers Six S proposes using the standard (i.e., non-custom) API for customer creation. This will not require any development. However, the associated quote includes ~5 hours for technical assistance.  Suppliers Six S proposes using the standard (i.e., non-custom) API for supplier creation. This will not require any development. However, the associated quote includes ~5 hours for technical assistance  Dashboards / Reports It is anticipated that dashboards/reports related to this integration will be needed, though they have not been specified yet. The associated quote includes ~20 hours for development and documentation of reporting items to be specified at a later date. This document will be updated with the details of all created items as they are designed and developed.', 'Components': 'Part Screen, New Layer, Add “Link to AP” checkbox., AR Invoice Creator, Function / API Endpoint, Allow submission of AR Invoice data to Kinetic'}

This entails loading the machine with higher grade lumber than is required for the job. The operator will then tell the machine that it a different grade.

This causes a problem as this lumber will not match any of the materials on the job and the integration cannot calculate a proper distribution ratio for the lumber.  The integration should be enhanced to add support for lumber that has been downgraded. Note: This enhancement is dependent on changes being made by System TM.

The logic on how to pull in these files was provided by the customer and is found in the case attachment “Private Sub Batch Print”:  Ability to print a new Cut List report  Note: Conviron has provided a document detailing their need and had a scoping call with Six S. The scoping call was recorded for later reference.', 'Solution': ' Batch Printing A new “Batch Print” checkbox has been added to the ECO Material (ECOMtl) table and made visible within the Engineering Workbench. This checkbox will be used to denote attachments that should be included in the batch printing logic. This checkbox has also been made visible within the material list view as indicated in this screenshot:  This Batch Print field will also be present on the JobMtl table and made visible/editable within Job Entry via the UD Column Mapping functionality.  A new “Print Shop Packet” button will be added to the Job Traveler screen. (i.e., The screen used to print the Job Traveler) When clicked, this button will perform the following logic: Review all Job Materials on all BOM levels and locate all that have “Batch Print” selected. For each material, look up the corresponding ECOMtl record to check if it has the “Batch Print” checkbox selected. If no materials are located, the user will be alerted, and no further steps will be taken. Review the part records for all batch print materials. Locate all PDF files in the relevant network locations (see “Private Sub BatchPrint.docx” attached to case) Note:  Six S will follow the same logic that is currently outlined in the “Private Sub BatchPrint.docx” file. If Conviron wishes to change this behavior, it will require additional billed hours.  If no relevant files are found for a part, the user will be alerted, and no further steps will be taken. Ask the user to select a printer. Print all relevant PDF files from the network location to the selected printer. Display a message to the user to confirm that the print job was submitted. E.g., “Printing complete, 8 documents printed for 4 parts.” Note: This customization is reliant on the client PC being able to print the relevant attachments. If a user’s PC can’t print a given document, it will not be printed. e.g., Users should have Acrobat installed if they wish to print PDFs. If .dwg drawing are to be printed, client PCs require an application that can print those files. Etc.

Related to case 2311 done by Eli on Nov 14.   This was done through coding in a data directive on the RCVdtl table. I have run into an issue with it as when you click on the SAVE in receipt entry to run the calculations it makes the whole PO quantity go into the “Arrived” column as the our quantity when a line is created is the full amount. Making the arrived and received quantity issues different and causing issues when receiving the next packing slip against that PO. We do not know the our quantity until this calculation takes place so I need help with changing it or moving it somewhere so it doesn’t “arrive” this full quantity.

Currently this is being via a custom app developed with MS Access in conjunction with BAQs and the DMT tool. Scheduling order is dependent on much expertise and process-specific knowledge. As such, Plastibec would like their schedulers to easily view their outstanding jobs and sequence them in bulk. In addition to changing Start Dates, they also need to be able to be able to easily change the resource/operation for the job. (Note that in Plastibec’s case, there is a one-to-one relationship between resources and operations.)  Start times for operations will be calculated dynamically based on the user-supplied sequence when the rescheduling logic is triggered.  Plastibec also needs a dashboard that will let them easily adjust the production calendar for their resources. They make numerous, regular adjustments to the calendar and the standard interface is too cumbersome.  A scoping call was performed and Kris Taylor at Plastibec gave a thorough demo of the current tool. A recording of this demo has been attached to this case and will be reviewed by the assigned developer.', 'Solution': ' Scheduling Dashboard Six S will create an updateable dashboard to facilitate Plasticbec’s scheduling process. Note: Plastibec’s Job BoMs follow a specific format where certain types of operations and materials always have a specific sequence. \ne.g., Opr 150 is always the Extruder, Mtl 40 is always paper, etc.  This dashboard will display all operations for open, released jobs.  Filters – All Optional Operation Start Date Operation End Date Part Number Display Columns – All are pulled from the operation unless otherwise noted. Sequence A user entered value. Used to re-order the operations for scheduling purposes. This is a temporary value used during the scheduling process and will not be saved. Resource Group Shift Calculated value. Shift when an operation will run, based on the start time. Job Number Start Date Updateable Field End Date Estimated Production Hours Start Time End Time Part Number – Part being produced by the job. Part Description Production Qty Production Qty UOM Die ID of operation with sequence 20 Roller ID of operation with sequnce 10 Order Num Order related to job via demand link Order Line Resource Updateable Field There will always be exactly one resource for any given operation. Estimated Setup Hours Qty Completed Material 10 Part Num of material sequence 10 Material 10 Description Description of material sequence 10 Die Description Description of Die operation Roller Description Description of Roller operation Material 20 Part Num of material sequence 20 Material 20 Description Description of material sequence 20 Material 21 Part Num of material sequence 21 Material 21 Description Description of material sequence 21 Paper Part Part Num of material sequence 40 Paper Part Description Description of material sequence 40 Material 50 Part Num of material sequence 50 Material 50 Description Description of material sequence 50 Users will enter an integer value in the Sequence field to specify the order in which operations should be scheduled.  When the Apply Schedule button is clicked all operations will be rescheduled. The schedule will be determined by “stacking” all operations for a given day based on their sequence and estimated duration. (i.e., Estimated Setup Hours + Estimated Production Hours) e.g., Operation sequence 1 will be scheduled at the start of the day. Operation sequence two will be scheduled to begin at the end of operation 1. Operation 3 will start at the end of operation 2. Etc. This logic will take Calendar Exceptions and already scheduled operations (assuming they are not being rescheduled) into account. If a given resource is not available on a given time/date, the schedule will move on to the next available timeslot. If the resource does not have sufficient hours to accommodate a given operation an error will be logged. These error messages will be collected during the scheduling process and displayed to the user at the conclusion of the process.  Calendar Configuration / Exception Dashboard This dashboard will be filterable by resource. It will display a record for 60 days, starting from the current date. Each record will show the following fields: Date Resource ID Hours Updateable column. This is a dropdown with values 0, 8, 16, and 24.  The value selected here will set the number of hours this resource is available on the relevant day. Hours Hours resource is currently configured to be active. Net Hours Active Hours – Hours of work already scheduled for this resource on this date. E.g., If the resource is scheduled to be active for 16 hours and there are 7 hours of work scheduled, this fild will display “9”. Changes to this dashboard will be applied as Calendar Exceptions for the relevant resource and date. It is stipulated that Plastibec will have a default Production Calendar with all resources scheduled to be available 24 hours a day. (Or whatever Plastibec’s “default” availability might be.) This dashboard will then create Calendar Exceptions to limit capacity/availability as specified by the user. When a change is made to any given resource/date, the logic will remove any existing Calendar Exceptions and replace them with the currently specified values.', 'Components': 'Scheduler, Function, Perform Scheduling'}

At present they will not be using the fulfillment Workbench to allocate.  Inventory transfer ( Same logic exists for Customer Shipments) You can only transfer one lot per transfer. We need to be able to select multiples lot that sum up to the quantity I need to transfer.  Also, when I’m selecting lot numbers it gives me every lot number currently in the system regardless of which lot is in the bin I’m selecting. It should only show lots that are in the current bin you’re transferring out. Also, lot #1 below has been already transferred and it’s still showing.

They need an efficient way of selecting multiple lots during these processes. Six S is proposing an enhancement of the Customer Shipment Entry screen that will allow users to select multiple lots and have them simultaneously added to the current pack. For transfers, Six S is proposes adding a new “Bulk Transfer” section to the existing screen. This screen will allow users to enter a part number along with a “From” bin and a “To” bin. They will then be able to view all lots in the “From” bin and transfer whichever they see fit.', 'Solution': ' Customer Shipment Entry A new “Select Multiple” button will be added next to the standard “Lot” field.  Location where button will be added. Note:\nThis button will only be added in the “From Inventory” section. (Based on the assumption that Muir only ships from inventoyr.) If Muir will be shipping directly from jobs, please inform Six S so the functionality can be duplicated in the “From Manufacturing” section. When clicked, this button will allow users to view all lots in the currently selected Bin and select as many as they wish.  After selecting lots, a new line will be added to the pack for each lot. The newly created lines will be populated with the same Sales Order, Line, Release, Warehouse, and Bin as the original line.  The quantity for each line will be set to the entire available quantity for the given lot within the relevant bin.  Inventory Transfer A new “Bulk Transfer” section will be added to the standard Inventory Transfer screen. This section will have the following fields: Part Number From Warehouse From Bin To Warehouse To Bin Users will need to populate all of these fields before proceeding. After populating these fields, a “Transfer Lots” button will allow users to select from a list of all lots for the chosen part number that are stored in the “From” bin. After selection, all lots will be transferred from the “From” bin to the “To” bin. This logic will transfer the entire available quantity of the lot.

This software is communicating with their current system via ODBC. Kinetic/Epicor is a cloud-based system and does not permit ODBC connections to the database. Additionally, as with any new system the field and table names will be different than the legacy system. Muir tapes needs technical assistance with accessing the Kinetic OData API in order to retrieve label data. Additionally, they would like Six S to convert 20-25 queries from their existing labels into BAQs to simplify data retrieval. Muir tapes will provide these queries to Six S as they work through their labels. Six S has not reviewed these queries and is basing this estimate on the subset of queries they have already seen. Note: Six S will provide information, assistance, and other support with connecting to the Kinetic API. However, configuration and label design within CODESOFT will ultimately be the responsibility of Muir Tapes.', 'Solution': ' Six S will review SQL queries provided by Muir tapes and convert them to BAQs that will act as data sources for CODESOFT labels. Based on the examples provided by Muir Tapes to date, this design and the associated quote is expect to cover 20-25 queries. However, more or less time may be required depending on the complexity of the queries and the precise number of BAQs that are ultimately required.

Do you have any 6S team members that are power users of Service Connect? We have several seats of Epicor Enterprise Edition Service Connect Run Time Only which means that we can run flows but we cannot create them. If we gave you requirements could a 6S team member create a flow for us to be able to incorporate in our instance to import orders from a .csv file either in a network folder or as an email is received to a specific inbox with a .csv attachment to be processed. There is some urgency to this request. Requirements:  I am requesting the fields from the Power Systems team right now so this might be delayed a bit but we need the following: PO lines (1 to many orders, 1 to many order lines) from several different companies will be sent in by email to an outlook email account (specified only for this purpose) with a .csv or excel formatted attachment at all times of the day and all days of the week. The flow will open the email and open the attachment It will load all PO lines to a temp table in a SQL database A comparison will be made between newly added PO lines and view or order lines for customer in SQL view by a concatenated field of Customer Num, PO Num, PO Line to Customer Num, PO Num, Order Dtl Line. Only create new orders and order line items in Epicor for each unique line. Total all orders and lines generated in file and send in report to customer email on file. If there is an error, send by email to IT or Sales contact by email. When process complete, clear temp table and rename email subject to add – complete Wait on next email to process orders. .', 'Problem': '  Power Systems needs to import order information into Epicor. These orders will be delivered as CSV files attached to emails from a variety of addresses. Orders will be created, however updates will NOT be allowed. If duplicate data (i.e., A second copy of an order) is received, it should generate an error. After order information is processed, an email needs to be dispatched to either IT or the customer depending on success of the import.', 'Solution': ' Order Import Service This will be an Windows Service that is configured to poll for new emails on a recurring schedule. The schedule will be configurable and support intervals as short as every minute. This service will check a specified mailbox and look for unread emails with CSV attachments. Emails without attachments, or with non-CSV attachments will be ignored. When a relevant email is located, the following logic will be executed: Attachment and source address will be collected from the email and passed to an Order Creator function.  Described in following section. This is an internal function within this service. It is described separately for the sake of clarity. If Order Creator is able to successfully import the file: Email(s) will be sent to the customer(s) associated with the resulting orders. The original email will then be deleted. If Order Creator fails to import the file:  An email will be dispatched to a static address for Power Systems’ IT department. This message will be a forwarded copy of the original email with details of the error appended. Original email will be marked as read and left in the mailbox. This service will have the following options which will be configurable by editing a ‘standard’ .NET-style XML configuration file. App Server URL  Server hosting the Epicor application Instance Epicor Instance where orders should be sent\nE.g., Test, Pilot, Production, etc Epicor User Epicor Password Polling Interval Interval between polls for new messages.  Denominated in seconds. Test Mode If the service is placed in Test Mode, emails will not be deleted after processing. Messages will be left in place and re-imported at the next polling event. This is intended to support iterative testing without requiring repetitive generation of new messages. \ni.e., Allows import logic to be tested repeatedly on the same message(s). Failure Email Address to notify when an import fails. BCC Email Optional. All emails generated by this service will be BCC’d to this address. SMTP Server SMTP Port SMTP User SMTP Password Expose Importer Webservice It this flag is set, the Order Importer function (described below) will be exposed as a web service. Note: This service will use NLog for logging. There will be an additional file to configure logging options in the standard NLog format. Details on NLog configuration can be found on the NLog website:\n  Order Importer This is a function within the service. It will be exposed as a webservice based on a configuration flag. This function will accept CSV data originating in attachments to emails parsed by this service. (CSV’s will be converted to a datatable or similar object before being passed to the function.) Note: This design and the associated quote assumes all CSV files will be in the same format. If multiple formats need to be supported, additional development time may be required. This function will review the Customer Number and PO Number to determine whether a corresponding sales order exists in the system. If the sales order exists, an error will be generated. Epicor will not be modified and the originating email will be forwarded to Power Systems’ IT department. If the order does not exist, it will be created. Lines will be added for each row within the CSV file. Upon successful creation of the order, an email will be dispatched to the default email address for the customer. The message will contain the following information for each order/line created: PO Number Sales Order Number Ship To Address Line Number Part Number Quantity  Unit Price Extended Price Total PO Price  This is the ‘final’ PO price, inclusive of all taxes, fees, discounts, etc that have been configured within Epicor.', 'Components': 'Order Importer, Windows Service, Check for new emails and create sales orders'}

Would you be able to take a look at this and let us know if we can discuss this possibility?   Thanks,   Jeff Rawlings  Rawlings@midwestmetal.com EDI Specialist MidWest Metal Products Phone: (765)287-3108', 'Problem': '  Midwest would like to take advantage of Amazon Transportation’s (AT) new API which can provide a shipping label via a single API call. The API currently being used requires 3 calls and takes an unreasonable amount of time to comelete. Additionally, the current solution relies on a dedicated “Amazon Freight” button which users must be made aware of and trained on. They would prefer to have a single “Freight” function in Customer Shipment Entry that will generate the correct label without requiring special knowledge or steps by the user. Note: \nThe AT API requires “SellingParty” and “ShipFromParty” values to be provided. This design assums that Midwest will be able to provide these values or let Six S know where to retrieve them when development begins.', 'Solution': ' Label Retrieval Six S will create an Epicor Function that connects to the Amazon Transportation API (documentation provided by Midwest) and retrieves a label for a given shipment. This function will take the following parameters: Pack number Current user’s workstation (Used to identify printer) The function will lookup the PO Number on the Sales Order associated with the shipment. It will then make a call to AT’s “CreateShippingLabelsRequest” web service. If the AT service returns an error, the message will be relayed to the end user. If a label is returned it will be printed on the default label printer associated with the specified workstation. This function will be used to replace the current logic used for printing Amazon labels. Customer Shipment Entry This screen will be modified to merge the functionality of the “Amazon Freight” button with the standard “Freight” function. Both buttons will be removed/hidden and a new custom “Freight” function will be added. When triggered, this function will perform the following steps: Review Ship Via to determine if the current pack is shipping via AT or an alternate method. If the pack is shipping via AT: The custom “Label Retrieval” function will be triggered to retrieve an AT shipping label. This label will be printed at the default label printer for the user’s workstation. The pack will be marked “Shipped”. Processing will complete. If the pack is shipping via a non-AT method: The standard Epicor freight logic will be triggered. Essentially, the new button will replicate the standard “Freight” button with the addition of the ability to properly generate and print labels for AT shipments.  Fulfillment Workbench This screen has an existing SMP button that generates shipments on the My Selections tab.  This function will be modified to also generate and print labels for any orders that are shipping via AT. If an order is shipping via AT, the following steps will be executed: The custom “Label Retrieval” function will be triggered to retrieve an AT shipping label. This label will be printed at the default label printer for the user’s workstation. The pack will be marked “Shipped”. Processing will proceed to the next order. Note: This function was developed quite some time ago. It may benefit from refactoring to bring the code inline with current best practices. If minor refactoring is needed, it will be done as part of this project. If more extensive refactoring is warranted, Six S will contact Midwest to discuss the issues that have been identified, time required to rectify and related decisions.', 'Components': 'Label Retriever, Function, Retrieve and print Amazon Transportation Labels, Fulfillment Workbench, Customization, Update “SMP” function to accommodate AT shipments.'}

Additional requirements should perform the following: Display WIP subassemblies as completed (with an override to ship subassemblies that are not flagged Operation ‘Complete’) – every subassembly will have at least one operation.  Allow the user to select completed subassemblies from multilevel assembly jobs, to be included in the Pack ID Allow the user to select the Quantity to be shipped.

Additionally, they need the ability to monitor which subassemblies have already shipped.', 'Solution': ' Six S will build a “Subassembly Shipment Dashboard” screen. This dashboard will list all subassemblies for active jobs. i.e., Jobs that have been engineered and released and not fully shipped. This dashboard will only display Make-To-Order jobs. Subassemblies where the previously shipped quantity is equal or greater to the total required quantity for the subassembly will not be shown. This dashboard will have the following filters and columns: Filters – All are optional Job Number Sales Order Number Part Number Final product of the job. Subassembly Part Number Customer ID  Display Columns Customer ID Customer Name Sales Order Number Job Number Req Date Part Number Top level part for the job. Subassembly Part Number Prior Shipments A comma-separated list of any prior pack numbers related to this subassembly. Subassembly Completed Qty  Determined by completed quantity of final operation on the subassembly. Subassembly Shipped Qty Previously shipped quantity Subassembly Shippable Qty Completed Qty – Shipped Qty Qty To Ship This is an editable field that will allow users to enter the quantity they wish to ship. If a user enters a value greater than the completed quantity a warning message will be displayed. \nNote: This will be a warning message, not an error/exception. It will not prevent the user from proceeding. This dashboard will also have a “Ship Selected” button. When this button is clicked, a Miscellaneous shipment will be created for all subassemblies where a “Qty To Ship” has been provided. Subassemblies will be grouped by destination, i.e., the Ship To location of the related Sales Order. If multiple subassemblies are going to the same Ship To, they will be placed on a single shipment with one line per subassembly. Otherwise, each assembly will be placed on a distinct shipment. Shipments will be directed to the Ship To address of the sales order related to a given job / assembly. The job number and assembly sequence will be stored on the pack line. \n If any subassemblies cannot be shipped, an error will be displayed to the user. After processing a message will be displayed to the user informing them of the packs that were created for each subassembly. For example: Shipment Summary Job-Assembly\tPack\n1324-5 \t\t123\n0005914-22 \t500\n000781-11\t601 After shipment is complete, the dashboard will be refreshed.', 'Components': 'Assembly Shipper, Function, Generate Miscellaneous Shipments.'}

We are wondering how you would quote solving this problem. We have Epicor quoting us a solution but we are curious how you would handle the problem and what the quote would look.\xa0  The problem at the most basic level: We want to use PO suggestions. When using PO suggestions, it groups parts into releases. Epicor currently groups parts into one line that have different costs. There is a material number of parts that have different costs due to a variety of reasons. We need Epicor to have the logic bult in that if the costs are different on a part, create multiple lines on the PO with the different costs.', 'Problem': '   Avis Corp uses PO suggestions to generate purchases orders for their Jobs. All purchased parts are direct to job and the cost of said parts comes from the material record where the part is listed on the job. A part might be listed multiple times on one job with different costs or it might be listed on multiple jobs again with different costs.  When generating PO suggestions by default Epicor will group all of these records into a single entry on a PO unless the user has specified a specific vendor on the job material record in which case Epicor will split the parts by vendor. However Epicor will not split the parts by the cost listed for said parts on the material records.  This is the functionality Avis is looking to add. When multiples of the same part come up in PO suggestions they want these separated by not only any vendor listed on the job material record for the part but also the cost of the part. This way when a PO is generated multiple lines for the same part will be generated on said PO with different costs for each line according to what was listed on the job.', 'Solution': ' Six S Parteners will use BPM’s and functions that will trigger on the outset of PO suggestions being run. We will allow PO suggestions to be created normally and then we will modify the suggestions list to split up any parts that have multiple costs on jobs. This will result in a PO suggestions list where a single part can be listed multiple times based on the different costs at the job level. These parts will show the costs as listed on the jobs and when PO’s are created they will have multiple lines for the same part provided the costs are different.', 'Components': 'PO Suggestions, Method Directive, Trigger function to modify suggestions, Modify suggestions, Function, Modify PO suggestions per the details above'}

If you double the number of orders you’re importing, it may take longer to import them. This is largely irrelevant to a dashboard like the one being described here. If Muir Tapes is loading extremely large datasets (i.e. thousands of records on the screen at once) they may see the dashboard slow down somewhat. But broadly speaking, it won’t be affected by data volumes. Warranty – The customer would like the warranty to be extended by 90 days after Go-Live to allow for thorough testing in live conditions.  Six S agrees to extend the warranty. Note, extended warranties are normally a billable service. However, as this is a relatively simple dashboard, Six S will extend the warranty at no cost.', 'Solution': ' Six S will  build an updatable dashboard to facilitate job scheduling. This dashboard will only show open, released jobs that would be available for scheduling via normal Epicor means.  All changes to job schedules done via this dashboard will be performed using Epicor’s Job Scheduling engine. i.e., Date fields will not simply be changed on the JobOper table.  This will ensure the requested schedule is accurately reflected throughout the system. It will also ensure that the requested schedule is subject to normal business logic and constraints. For example, if a user tries to schedule an operation on a resource that is not available at the requested time, an error will be raised. It will have the following filters and fields: Filters – All optional Job Number Part Number Operation Code A pair of starting/ending date filters These will filter on the job’s Request Date Fields Job number - JobHead.JobNum Part Number - JobHead. PartNum Part Description - JobHead.PartDescription Operation Seq - JobOper. OprSeq Operation Code  - JobOper.OpCode Quantity Required – JobOper.ProductionQty Quantity Remaining - JobOper.ProductionQty-JobOper.QtyCompleted Setup Time  - JobOper.EstSetHours Estimated Total Run Time - JobOper.EstProdHours Schedule Direction Updatable Mandatory Drop down with two options: Forward, Backward Date Updatable Mandatory If “Forward” scheduling is selected, this will become the Start Date of the operation If “Backward” scheduling is selected, the operation will be backward scheduled from this date. Time  Updatable Mandatory If “Forward” scheduling is selected, this will become the Start Time of the operation If “Backward” scheduling is selected, the operation will be backward scheduled from this time. (In conjunction with the date in the prior column.)  Due Date  - JobOper.DueDate Updatable Due Time - JobOper.DueHour Updatable Resource Group - JobOpDtl.ResourceGrpID Resource - JobOpDtl.ResourceID Updatable Move Option Updatable Mandatory Dropdown with options replicating the “Move Option” field in the “Proposed Changes” section of the standard job scheduling screen. A second panel will show the following fields, filtered based on the row selected in the top, “main” grid. Sales Order Number Blank if job does not have a demand link to a sales order. Customer Name Blank if job does not have a demand link to a sales order. Job Material – Part Number Based on “Related Operation” field on JobMtl table.  Note: If multiple materials are related to the current operation, multiple rows will be displayed in this grid. Job Material – On hand quantity  Same notes as prior column Job Material – Net quantity Same notes as prior column This is the quantity that will be remaining after the current job is completed. i.e.:\nOn hand quantity – Quantity required by current job Next Receipt Date Next date that there is a PO due or a Job Receipt expected. i.e., The next date that additional quantity of this part will arrive in inventory. Next Use Next job operation that will need this part, based on scheduled date. This may be a operation on the current job or any other job. Unscheduled jobs/operations will not be considered in this calculation. Suggestions from Epicor Type of any existing PO Suggestion for this part (Create, reschedule, etc) Days late/on time If a PO exists for this part, this will be the number of days between the PO’s due date and the current date. If the PO is not late, this field will display zero. If multiple POs are present, this will be calculated based on the first expected PO. UOM As specified on JobMtl table Customer ID Blank if job does not have a demand link to a sales order. Customer’s Sales Rep Blank if job does not have a demand link to a sales order. Comments Job header comments', 'Components': 'Job Scheduling, Dashboard, Allow review of jobs and easy rescheduling.'}

You can only receive one log per transaction in order to be able to assign an internal lot code. One lot = 1 log. One line for PO 167 for material code cv45F-36x24-L needs 36 lines to be created for receiving, to assign a lot # each log   We need an easier and faster way to input lot numbers. Can’t the 2 fields: EPICOR lot number and manufacturer lot number be added to the line details screen.', 'Problem': '  Muir Tapes often receives Purchase Orders with a high number of lots for a given part. Manually entering each part number, lot number,  and the associated quantity during the receiving process is extremely tedious. They would like a faster way to input this data.', 'Solution': ' Six S will add a new “Lot Import” grid to the Line Detail section of the Receipt Entry screen. This grid will have four columns: Part Number Lot Number  Quantity UOM Users will be able to paste rows of data into this grid or enter manually a la Excel. After entering data, an “Apply” button will allow users to create receipt lines for these entries.  This grid will only be active on lines that have data populated. This is because the “Apply” logic will use the current line as the basis for the newly created lines.  When the “Apply” button is clicked, the following logic will take place: Validate that the current line has been saved.  If it has not been saved, an error will be presented to the user. Validate that all part numbers listed in the grid are the same as the current receipt line.  If there are any mismatches, an error will be presented to the user. Validate that all listed UOMs are valid for the current part.  If any invalid UOMs are detected, an error will be presented to the user. Validate that the sum quantity for the lines corresponds to the PO listed on the current receipt line. If a user is attempting to receive more than the total PO quantity, a warning will be presented to them. The user will have the option to halt processing or ignore the error and continue. (Provided Epicor is configured to allow receipts beyond the ordered quantity.) Create a new line on the current receipt for each row in the grid. Part, Lot, UOM and Quantity will be set to the values of the current grid row. PO Number, Line, Release and other required fields will be populated with the values from the current receipt line. When all lines have been created, the grid will be cleared and a message will be displayed confirming that processing is complete. In other words, a user will manually create the first line of the receipt and then enter/paste grid entries for all other lots. The logic will then duplicate the current receipt line, changing the lot number and quantity in accordance with the grid’s contents.', 'Components': ''}

The user will need to be able to enter data into this new field at both the Part table and the Supplier Price List>Supplier Part Detail table (PartXRefVend table). Formatting should contain 1000 + alphanumeric characters and be capable of entering and displaying data in a paragraph style. We’ll call this new field the “Purchase Part Description” field.  Data entered will need to be retrieved and displayed on all programs/applications where there is a Supplier and Part combination data element involved (Eg. Purchase Order Entry, Receipt Entry, AP Invoice Entry, etc). Likewise, this data will need to be retrievable into forms that print from those programs mentioned above, much the same as current Part.PartDescription data is retrieved today.  There is one additional requirement for the data in this new “Purchase Part Description” field. There should be a hierarchy for how the data is retrieved into applications and forms.  Condition 1): If there is a Part record with no corresponding Supplier Price List > Supplier Part Detail record, then retrieve the “Purchase Part Description” from Part table.  Condition 2) If there is a Part record with a corresponding Supplier Price List > Supplier Part Detail record, then retrieve the “Customer Part Description” from PartXRefVend table.  That is, the “Purchase Part Description” entered in the Part table is always the ‘default’ value retrieved, unless there is a corresponding Supplier Price List > Supplier Part Detail record with a more specific “Supplier Part Description” entered there.', 'Problem': '  Minus Forty would like the ability to store a new Supplier Part Description value for all parts. They would like to be able to store this at both the Part level and the Supplier Price List level.  The entry at the Part level will act as the “default” value for the field for purposes of display. However, if a Supplier Price List has the value populated, that value will be preferentially displayed, assuming the supplier is relevant to the current document. \ni.e., A purchase order for supplier ABC will never display the Supplier Part Description for a Supplier Part Number related to supplier XYZ. The Supplier Part Description field will be of the maximum possible size and entry screens will configured to support multi-line input. (Within the SQL database, all fields support “paragraph style” text. Some screens simply don’t allow text to be entered in that fashion.) This value should be displayed on multiple screens, listed explicitly in the following section. Note: Within the Kinetic application, UI changes are done on a per-screen basis. If Minus Forty would like this field visible in other places that can absolutely be accommodated. However, Six S will need to be informed of the specific locations where it is needed.', 'Solution': ' Six S will create two new Supplier Part Description fields. These fields will be placed on the following screens and their corresponding tables within the database. These will be string fields of the maximum allowable size. The corresponding controls will be configured to allow multi-line input. Part Table: Part Supplier Price List Table: PartXRefVend These fields will be displayed on the following screens. If a Supplier Part number has been used on the relevant document and it has a Supplier Part Description populated, that value will be show. If the cross reference does not have a Supplier Part Description populated, the value from the Part table will be displayed. Screens: Purchase Order Entry On the line detail panel Receipt Entry On the line detail panel AP Invoice Entry On the line detail panel Job Entry On the header panel On the material detail panel Note: Supplier Part Cross Reference values will only be displayed for Buy-to-Job materials. All other materials will default to the value stored on the Part table. These new field will be available for use in reports, dashboards and all other areas of the system. However, this design does not include the actual placement of the fields on any areas other than those specifically listed above. If this field is needed in additional locations, please inform Six S before development begins so that this design and the accompanying quote can be adjusted accordingly.

The user will need to be able to enter data into this new field at both the Part table and the CustXPrt table. Formatting should contain 1000 + alphanumeric characters and be capable of entering and displaying data in a paragraph style. We’ll call this new field the “Customer Part Description” field.  Data entered will need to be retrieved and displayed on all programs/applications where there is a Customer and Part combination data element involved (Eg. Opportunity/Quote Entry, Order Entry, Customer Shipment Entry, AR Invoice Entry, etc). Likewise, this data will need to be retrievable into forms that print from those programs mentioned above, much the same as current Part.PartDescription data is retrieved today.  There is one additional requirement for the data in this new “Customer Part Description” field. There should be a hierarchy for how the data is retrieved into applications and forms.  Condition 1): If there is a Part record with no corresponding Customer Part Cross Reference record, then retrieve the “Customer Part Description” from Part table.  Condition 2) If there is a Part record with a corresponding Customer Part Cross Reference record, then retrieve the “Customer Part Description” from CustXPrt table.  That is, the “Customer Part Description” entered in the Part table is always the ‘default’ value retrieved, unless there is a corresponding Customer Part Cross Reference record with a more specific “Customer Part Description” entered there.', 'Problem': '  Minus Forty would like the ability to store a new Customer Part Description value for all parts. They would like to be able to store this at both the Part level and the Customer Part level.  The entry at the Part level will act as the “default” value for the field for purposes of display. However, if a Customer Part has the value populated, that value will be preferentially displayed, assuming the customer is relevant to the current document. \ni.e., An order for customer ABC will never display the Customer Part Description for a Customer Part Number related to customer XYZ. The Customer Part Description field will be of the maximum possible size and entry screens will configured to support multi-line input. (Within the SQL database, all fields support “paragraph style” text. Some screens simply don’t allow text to be entered in that fashion.) This value should be displayed on multiple screens, listed explicitly in the following section. Note: Within the Kinetic application, UI changes are done on a per-screen basis. If Minus Forty would like this field visible in other places that can absolutely be accommodated. However, Six S will need to be informed of the specific locations where it is needed.', 'Solution': ' Six S will create two new Customer Part Description fields. These fields will be placed on the following screens and their corresponding tables within the database. These will be string fields of the maximum allowable size. The corresponding controls will be configured to allow multi-line input. Part Table: Part Customer Part Cross Reference Table: CustXPrt These fields will be displayed on the following screen. If a Customer Part number has been used on the relevant document and it has a Customer Part Description populated, that value will be show. If the cross reference does not have a Customer Part Description populated, the value from the Part table will be displayed. Screens: Opportunity/Quote Entry On the line detail panel On the material detail panel within BoMs. Order Entry On the line detail panel On the release detail panel Customer Shipment Entry On the line detail panel AR Invoice Entry On the line detail panel Job Entry On the header panel On the material detail panel Note: Customer Part Cross Reference values will only be displayed for Make-To-Order jobs. All other jobs will default to the value stored on the Part table. These new field will be available for use in reports, dashboards and all other areas of the system. However, this design does not include the actual placement of the fields on any areas other than those specifically listed above. If this field is needed in additional locations, please inform Six S before development begins so that this design and the accompanying quote can be adjusted accordingly. (Alternatively, a new case can be opened at a later date to add fields to additional screens.)', 'Components': 'AR Invoice Entry, Layer, ExposeCustomer Part Descriptionfield, Job Entry, Layer, ExposeCustomer Part Descriptionfield, Opportunity / Quote Entry, Layer, ExposeCustomer Part Descriptionfield, Customer Part Cross Reference, Layer / UD Field, Create and exposeCustomer Part Descriptionfield., Order Entry, Layer, ExposeCustomer Part Descriptionfield, Customer Shipment Entry, Layer, ExposeCustomer Part Descriptionfield, Part, Layer / UD Field, Create and exposeCustomer Part Descriptionfield.'}

The 20th digit of the SSCC code is a calculated number, otherwise known as the “check-digit”. Epicor’s PCID functionality will be used to generate the SSCC code, however basic functionality of the Control ID Maintenance program is unable to generate the calculated the check digit segment of the PCID number.

The 20th digit is a check digit calculated based on the values of the prior 19 digits. OMC requires a modification to the system so that SSCC values can be properly calculated.', 'Solution': ' Six S will apply a BPM to the PCID generation functionality.

If this value is not exactly 19 digits, an error will be generated, and the user will be informed that a PCID / SSCC could not be calculated. This value will be passed to an SSCC Calculator function. This function will calculate the check digit according to the algorithm detailed below. The check digit will be appended to the PCID number yielding an 20-digit SSCC with a proper check digit. This calculated value will then be returned to Epicor and processing will continue per the normal logic, using the updated 20-digit SSCC. SSCC Check Digit Calculation Algorithm A proper SSCC is a 20-digit number. The first two digits are 0 and the 20th digit is a calculated check digit.

In their current process the user is required to go to each line on an order, open the configurator, click save then close the configurator. This is so that the configurator can set the values correctly based on the CFG Part Num.  They would like to automate this process to remove the manual intervention needed to get the configurator to update.', 'Solution': ' Six S Partners will make use of BPM’s and functions to accomplish the following:  Whenever a CFG PartNum is changed on any order line an automation will run that will set the configurator correctly as per that part number. In effect replicating the output that is received when the configurator is manually opened and saved. By running this every time, the CFG PartNum is changed we remove the need for anyone to do anything on the order itself as by the time the user gets to the order this process is completed. It will also re-run every time said part number changes keeping all order lines up to date at all times.   Notes: All development will be done in the classic environment.  Due to the way configurator works we may have to actually update values on screens rather than in the background. The additional time this may take is being accounted for in the quote.', 'Components': ''}

For all revenue below 60% of the total project cost, transactions should post to WIP Inventory accounts. For all revenue at or above 60% of the project cost, transactions should post to the default locations.  When project costs change, any following recognition actions should generate ‘balancing’ journal entries so that at any given time, the first 60% of the project’s cost will have been posted to WIP inventory accounts.', 'Solution': ' Six S will create a custom posting rule to direct Project Revenue to WIP Inventory accounts when the amount of revenue being recognized is less than 60% of the estimated project cost. This calculation will include any previously recognized revenue when determining whether the 60% threshold has been met. Revenue that meets the 60% threshold will post to the Deferred Revenue accounts.   Note on the capabilities of Posting Rules:  Custom posting rules allow transactions to be directed to specific accounts, however they do NOT allow transaction amounts to be modified or single transactions to be split up. This means that any given revenue recognition transaction will be directed to a single location. For example: Assume a project has had 55% of the cost recognized to date. If another 10% is recognized, it will ALL be directed to the Deferred Revenue account. The posting rules cannot send 5% to WIP and 5% to Deferred Revenue. In order to overcome the limitation above, Six S will create a BPM and accompanying Epicor Functions that will perform journal entries to direct sums to the correct accounts. The BPM will fire after each Project Revenue Recognition occurrence. The BPM will then trigger a function which will perform the following steps: Calculate total cost to date for the project. Calculate total revenue recognized to date and location of it’s posting. e.g., “$100,000 has been recognized. $55,000 is in WIP accounts, the remaining $45,000 is in Deferred Revenue accounts.” Determine the correct posting “ratio” based on the rule that postings below 60% of the estimated cost should go to the WIP Inventory accounts and all remaining postings should go to Deferred Revenue. E.g., “$38,000 should be posting to WIP Inventory. The remaining $62,000 should be posted to Deferred Revenue.” A second function will then be triggered to perform Journal Entries, placing the revenue in the correct accounts. Continuing with the prior example: $100,000 has been recognized. $55,000 is in the WIP Inventory account. $38,000 should be in the WIP Inventory account. Result: Function creates a Journal Entry, transferring $17,000 from WIP Inventory to Deferred Revenue.', 'Components': 'Journal Entry Creator, Function, Create Journal Entries to ‘rebalance’ postings., Revenue Recognition – Post Process, BPM, Trigger function to ‘rebalance’ postings., Revenue Recognition, Posting Rule, Direct revenue to appropriate account'}

This will be a post-Processing method directive BPM. When this BPM is executed, it will review all invoices in the current group. If multiple invoices are found for the same project and order (i.e., Multiple milestones have been completed) all lines will be consolidated on the one invoice per milestone. After the lines have been consolidated, the extraneous invoices will be deleted from the group. e.g., If four invoices are created for an order for a project, (2 milestones completed for a sales order with 2 lines) the lines from the 2nd invoice will be moved to the 1st invoice which is for the first milestone and the lines from the 4th invoice will be moved to the 3rd invoice which is for the second milestone. The 2nd and 4th invoices will then be deleted, leaving one invoice per order per milestone with lines for each order line. If there were multiple orders involved, then it would be one invoice per order per milestone for all order lines and milestones. Here is an example output of the invoices going in and out: Starting Invoices/Lines: 1.1 2.1 3.1 4.1 Ending Invoices/lines: 1.1 1.2 3.1 3.2 Note:  All customizations will be performed in the Kinetic UI.', 'Components': ''}

I have created a preliminary dashboard to show BGM and parts on the quote that do not have an existing part cross refence for that customer. Those are the part numbers that need to be created in Epicor. This could require a UD field “Customer” (the customer ID) on the part to identify the customer.  I have tested this; I am using the “Market Availability” field as the customer ID for testing. The new plan would be to use this BAQ to create new part numbers.  New part creation dashboard Will be based off the new quote dashboard as listed above. Will define new parts where there is a missing AN INTERNAL BGM part number for that customer. Will require a part class, on each quote material or something along those lines to start the new part creation process. Those specifications are pretty close to what is on the design document. I think the only missing information is that they do require the Cust ID,-part class prefixed on the purchased parts created. Example CUS-RES-1234 Establish the new purchased part  manufacturer part cross reference to the newly created parts. The new manufactured part  (part they are selling)  comes right off of the quote.    The process from the dashboard Mandatory - Select the customer ID. Customer.CustID.  BGM will need to be set up as a customer.  Mandatory - Select part type. Part.TypeCode Mandatory if Purchased – Select or search for Manufacturer part number. PartXRefMfg.MfgPartNum Mandatory if purchased - Select or search for Supplier part number. PartXRefVend.VendPartNum Return results of existing part number tied to the customer part prefix if the cross reference and part already exists for this customer.  A pop up with the existing part number will be needed.  If it is a new record, proceed with data as required. If it exists for that customer, no further action is needed. If no existing part number cross reference exists for that part, Epico4 will create the new part number. If manufactured: Enter other data as required outlined in the manufacturing section A. Some might be flagged as required and will limit us to continue further until the required data is known. If purchased: Mandatory - Select Part class ID. Enter other data as required outlined in the purchased section B. Some might be flagged as required and will limit us to continue further until the required data is known. Save The part number is now entered in the part-master. Rev B additional information specification. The functionality of mass creating parts is desired. My original document is for creating one part at a time. For purchased parts Quote materials details will be loaded in the quote via DMT. The parts loaded will be using a manufacturer part number that is supplied by the customer. Most of their customers do not use any internal part number.  The process needs to look at the quote as a whole and an analyze any new manufacturer part numbers that are not currently tied to this customer (existing part number prefix could be a link) If the manufacturer part number does not exist, new parts are created. The only concern I have for this process and have not been able to solution is if the customer already has a part in stock that should be used, and the manufacturer part number be added to an existing part. A part description might be useful. For manufactured parts BGM will use the customer’s manufactured part number as their part number. We can either do this one as part of the mass update or manually.', 'Problem': '  BGM would like to have their part numbers generated automatically. They have two naming conventions, one for manufactured parts and another for purchased parts. They would like all parts to be created via a dashboard to facilitate selection of the required options. Additionally, they need the ability to mass create all part numbers for quotes that have been imported via DMT. (Solution will also work for non-DMT quotes.)', 'Solution': ' BPMs BPMs will be added to prevent the creation of new parts from any screen other than the newly created dashboard. If a user attempts to create a part in another area of the system, an error will be raised, and they will be prevented from doing so.  Part Creation Screen / Dashboard Note:\nThis screen will be based on the existing “BGM_QuotePartLookup” dashboard that was created as a proof of concept. This screen will be used to create new parts. It will be a dashboard showing quote materials that do not have a corresponding Customer Cross Reference record and/or Supplier Part Number. It will have the following optional filters: Customer Supplier Quote Number Part Class Users will be required to fill a selection of fields and then press a “Create Part” button. Provided all mandatory fields have been populated, the data will be submitted to a Function and new part(s) will be created with a name following the appropriate format. Fields:  This screen will also have a “Mass Create” section. This section will allow a user to select a specific quote and trigger a “Mass Create Parts” function (described below) to create records for all materials on the specified quote.  If any materials cannot be processed, the user will receive a message informing them accordingly. Part Creation Function This function will create new parts using data passed from the Part Creation screen. (Described above.) Part numbers will be automatically generated according to the following templates: Manufactured parts: <CustID>-<PartClass>-<SequentialNumber> Numbers will be padded to 5 digits.\nNote: This is preferable to starting at 4 and rolling over as it will cause numbers to sort more predictably within lists and grids. Sequence will unique per customer. E.g., DALTON-METAL-00001, AMAZON-CHIP-01234, etc Purchased Parts: <CustID>-<PartClass>-<SequentialNumber> Numbers will be padded to 5 digits.\nNote: This is preferable to starting at 4 and rolling over as it will cause numbers to sort more predictably within lists and grids. Sequence will unique per class E.g., 3M-RES-00001, AMAZON-ABR-00001, MCMASTER-ABR-00002, etc In addition to the Part record, a PartPlant record will be created for the current plant. (i.e., The plant the user is currently logged into.) For purchased parts, Supplier and Manufacturer Cross Reference records (i.e., PartXRefVend and PartXRefMfg) will also be created. All populated fields from the Part Creation screen will be transferred to the resulting part.  If any mandatory fields are not populated, an error will be returned to the user alerting them of relevant fields.  Mass Part Creation Function This function will review all materials on a specified quote. If any materials do not have corresponding parts in Epicor and/or the cross references that would be created by the Part Creation Function described above, the Part Creation Function will be triggered for that material.  All mandatory fields for part creation will be pulled from the quote material. If any required values are not present, an error will be returned to the user letting them know which materials could not be created.', 'Components': 'Part Creation, Screen, Allow users to create parts in controlled fashion'}

After speaking to the team, these are the items that we would like to have in the MES platform.   This is mainly to eliminate the paper logs we are currently doing along-side Epicor transactions.  And Also to be able to have the weld failure data in report form for the Engineers to pareto and conduct additional analysis of weld failures.', 'Problem': '  Problem  Safran Oil would like to eliminate paper based logging of weld inspections. They want to do this by adding the ability to generate these logs via entering additional data in the MES End Activity Screen. From the End Activity screen the following criteria must be met:  The weld spec ID associated with the part should be autogenerated and shown on the screen.  The user must be able to track and enter multiple failures with the following details: NDT Fail Failure Mode Weld Joint # Failure Quadrant/Location of Failure  After failures have been tracked a dashboard must be accessible in standard Epicor so that failures can be reviewed.', 'Solution': ' MES Screen Custom The End Activity screen in MES will be customized to add the following.  Inspection Specification: UD field that will auto retrieve the weld spec ID for the part number associated with the current job.  NDT Failure Grid: An updateable grid view with the following fields:  NDT Fail: Dropdown Field (R1, R2, PASS) Failure Mode: Dropdown Field (Porosity, Lack of Fusion, Lack of Penetration, Erosion Inclusion, Surface Indication, Cracks / Linears, Contamination)  Weld Joint # Failure: Integer Field Quadrant/Location of Failure: Integer Field The values saved in these fields will be stored in a UD table which links back to the LaborDtl record that was created through the end activity entry.   Dashboard The LaborDtl table linked with the new UD table will be used to display the output of these entries in a new dashboard. The fields on the dashboard will be as follows:  Date Work Order # (Job Number) Serial Number Qty Operation Rework (true/false) Weld Specification / Class  this comes from the Part.AnalysisCode value for the part that is on the Job header for the labor record that this NDT failure is linked to.  Rejection (RI, R2, Pass) Weld Failure Mode Weld Joint #  Failure Quadrant or location of weld failure  Inspector Name A to and from date will be added as a tracker view to the dashboard to allow the user to filter the results based on date.  Dashboard Locations: Menu Item: “Production Management > Quality Assurance > General Operations > NDT Failure Matrix” Add a tab to Job Tracker that shows this dashboard filtered for the current job and make this custom version of job tracker default for all instances. Add a button to the main page in MES called “NDT Failure Matrix” that shows this dashboard.    Notes:  The weld spec will need to be added to each part as a Header/Asm Analysis Code.  All work will be completed in the classic UI.', 'Components': 'NDT Table, UD Table, Store inspection data'}

Different customer different freight charge % Currently, we are adding them as Miscellaneous charge on a Order Header during order entry. Epicor already have automated discount % by customer, is there any option to automate freight % ? if not how we can customize it.  Wants to add an extra field to a Customized Crystal report (invoice report) Which was previously created by SIXS during Epicor implementation: We want to add a tracking number to our invoice report. I already changed report data definition but still that field is not showing in Crystal.  Negative Backflush: Epicor allows negative backflush. Can we create a BPM to stop negative backflush ?   Small SQL View based on current BAQ: We use third party Label View software to print labels. Currently we have a BAQ what we run and copy Part/SKU information to a excel file and that excel file is connected with LabelView Software to print labels.  Whenever we create any new SKU/Part we need to update that excel file manually. Is there a way we can create a small database for viewing purpose and which we will be connected with Labelview software?    ..', 'Problem': '  Loxcreen has four custom items which they need assistance with.  Default customer freight percentage Add tracking number to AR Invoices Prevent backflush when it would create a negative on hand quantity. Create a SQL view based on an existing BAQ.', 'Solution': ' Customer Freight  A new “Automatic Freight %” field will be added within the Customer screen. This field will be used to indicate the standard freight amount that will be applied to all orders for this customer.\n A new “Disable Automatic Freight” checkbox will be added to the Order Entry screen. This will be used to disable the Automatic Freight logic when users need to specify a custom freight amount.\n A new BPM will be added to the Order Update method. This method will calculate the total freight charge for this customer based on the percentage populated on the customer. The calculation will be:\n(Order Total – Discounts) * Freight% \nNote: Freight will be calculated on pre-tax values. \nThe BPM will then review the Miscellaneous Charges present on the current order header. If there is already a charge with type “Freight” of the calculated amount, no further logic will take place.\nIf there is no “Freight” charge present, a new charge will be created. If a charge is present, but the freight amount is incorrect, the amount will be modified accordingly.  Invoice Tracking Numbers The tracking number for shipments being invoiced will be added to the line of the AR Invoice report.\nNote: This is being done in Crystal.\n Negative Backflush A BPM will be added to the PartTran table. This BPM will monitor for backflush transactions that would result in a negative on-hand balance for the relevant part. If the backflush transaction would result in a negative on-hand quantity, an error will be raised. This error will prevent the inventory transaction and also prevent the activity that triggered the transaction. \nE.g., Reporting quantity against a job.  SQL View from BAQ Six S will contact Jainal to arrange a meeting. During this meeting, they will review the process of creating a new SQL view based on an existing BAQ. Note that the SQL displayed in the BAQ designer is not usable as-is and will need to be modified before it can be “converted” to a view. These changes will be covered in this meeting.', 'Components': 'Order Entry, Layer, Add “Disable Automatic Freight” field, Customer, Layer, Add “Freight %” field, SQL View, Meeting, Review creation of SQL veiws, AR Invoice, Crystal Report, Add tracking number, Backflush, BPM, Prevent negative transactions, Order Entry, BPM, Automatically create freight charges'}

Namely they would like: Allow the existing “Total Budget” Revenue Recognition method to be used within the SOLAR company for the Cincinnati plant. (Currently it is operating on projects for the Columbus plant.) Create an alternate Revenue Recognition function that can be run for specific, specified projects. (Current version always executes for all active projects.) Instruction on duplicating the current functionality.  Note: Six S will review and explain the current implementation. However, the function does not need to be duplicated in order to work in other companies/plants. The custom items simply need to be enabled for the relevant companies. Six S will demonstrate and explain this process as well.', 'Solution': ' Multi Company/Site Support Six S will adjust the current solution so that the company and site are exposed as arguments to the current Mass Revenue Recognition function.  This will allow the company and site (i.e. plant) to be specified when the function is scheduled Note:  Epicor allows any given function or other process to be scheduled in multiple instances with varying arguments. RBI will be able to trigger the function either manually or via scheduled execution with any arguments they choose.  In other words, the function can be scheduled once for the Columbus plant, an additional instance can be scheduled for Cincinnati, and further instances could be scheduled for other companies/plants without the need to duplicate the function or perform further code changes.  Project Specific Execution Six S will create new screen that allows RBI to enter multiple projects either by pasting a list into a grid or selecting them via a standard Epicor-style search screen. |\ni.e., The same type of search used to select a project within Project Entry. This screen will then allow users to trigger the custom Revenue Recognition function created in case 1867 for the specified projects. When processing completes, users will receive a pop-up notification informing them that Revenue Recognition has been completed for all selected projects. If a given project cannot be processed due to an error, the user will be informed of the error and related project IDs.  Training / Review Six S will schedule a meeting with RBI to review and explain the operation of the current solution along with how it can be deployed in other companies.', 'Components': 'Delpoyment, Task, Deploy solution to SOLAR company., Education, Meeting, Explain workings of solution'}

Minimal steps as possible  Note,  Durapaint does not own any of the products they paint and are only charging for the service to paint their customers products. They only stock paint and solvent. DIL Customization Part -  Need 2 new UD fields to input area and UOM of a part. This is to be used to determine the amount of paint needed as well be able to track for production. Area numeric field and the UOM dropdown. Note the dropdown selection should come from the list of UOM form the area UOM Class.    Quote   At the Quote Line panel add new UD fields. (BPM required to trigger the follow set-ups on the Quote Operation/Material panels) No Color Check box. If this check box is set to True, then the paint on the Paint Color dropdown will equal part ID – QuotePaint. (place holder part) Paint Color Dropdown. Dropdown to select the paint. Note, the selection list will include any purchase parts with a part class of Paint. (used on the Quote Material panel) Default Paint Line Dropdown. Dropdown list to select of four paint lines. Brampton Horizontal Brampton Vertical Scarborough Horizontal  Scarborough Vertical Note, the above record will be used to identify the Job operation as well as the Location where the painting may occur.

Note, if a part-on-the -fly is entered on the quote line then there 2 inputs will need to be entered.                   At Quote Operation panel. When the Operation is selected, it will automatically assign the associated Set-up Group which in turn will assign the Op-Standard linked to that Set-up group and the associated Production Standard. Note, majority of the time color is not selected at the quoting stage, hence above logic will not work and Durapaint personnel will need to fill in these fields manually. However, This quote line will be able to be pulled into a Sales Order Line or Job (quote Line marked as a template) as a starting point to configuring these records with less ,manually input.   Quote Material Panel. Part Number to be determined from the Color selected on the quote line panel. Unit cost will come from the Part Cost if the part exists in Epicor and has been purchased before, otherwise will need to be inputted manually. Qty. Per Parent – Calculation formula to be determined at a later date after input form the customer. This field will need to have the capability to override manually if needed.  Sales Order.

On the Job Header panel, add the following Fields. (BPM required to trigger the follow set-ups on the Job Header/Operation/Material) Note all jobs will have a demand link of Make-To-Order, hence the data can be pulled from the Sales Order Line.

Part – Paint to be determined by the Color selected at the Sales Order Line. Qty/Parent - will be determined at a later time unless this data is coming directly form a Quote Operation.', 'Problem': '  Durapaint wants to streamline their quote/sales order/job entry process by automating the selection of various values. By adding new UD fields to various panels, Durapaint aims to reduce manual data entry and improve accuracy and efficiency throughout the quote, sales order, and job processes. These changes affect the following areas of Epicor:  Part - add three new UD fields that will be used in quotes, orders and jobs Quote - add new UD fields to the Quote Line panel, The new fields will include a checkbox to indicate if a part requires paint, a dropdown to select the paint color, a dropdown to select a default paint line, and fields to determine the LF value/UOM and area value/UOM of a part. BPMs will work with these values to automate operation and material values for the quote line Sales Order - add new UD fields to the Sales Order Line panel. The new fields will be similar to those added in the Quote section and will be used to determine the paint color, default paint line, LF value/UOM, and area value/UOM of a part. These values will be used by BPM’s and UD field mapping to set values on the related Job.  Job - add new fields to the Job Header panel. The new fields will be used to automate the selection of materials, operations, and setup groups. A BPM will be required to trigger certain set-ups and fields need to allow for manual override as needed.', 'Solution': '  Six S will make following changes and additions:     Part:    Quote:     Sales Order:      Job:           Notes:  DefaultPaintLine fields are now driven by operations with an analysis code of “PaintLine” this analysis code needs to be added to the operations that match up with the paint lines. This was done to allow the paint line list to be dynamic.  This customization assumes one job per sales order line. It will not support multiple sales order lines being linked to a single job. It is possible to support this, but it will require changes to this design document.  If details on a UD fields for a sales order line are changed AFTER a job has been created for that line, the changes will not pass through to / affect the connected job.  Automations will only work correctly if there is only one operation and one material per quote /job. Adding multiple operations or materials will cause issues.', 'Components': ''}

I’m including a detailed document of those critical reports, so that Sixs can give us a good idea of the amount of work to re do or create new reports that comply with the requirements.  Please give us a quote of the estimated hours to support this effort.  .', 'Problem': '  GVA has several reports that do operate efficiently. The reports are resource intensive, time consuming to execute, have overly complicated designs, and exhibit similar/related issues. They would like these reports modified and/or recreated so that operate efficiently and are more inline with best practices. GVA has provided examples of the current reports along with details of the underlying BAQs and specific issues with each report. Reports needing attention: Balance Sheet Reported Problems: Report consumes a lot of resources and sometimes times out (even after updating timeout connection setups) Piles up balances over balances in not an efficient way. Inconsistent (adding an account segment value triggers issues with the subqueries grouping) When the report actually executes, takes 20/30 minutes to show up under the user request Categories not used in Epicor currently for segments. Layout needs changes. GVA has provided an example of their desired layout.  Vendor Aging Report GVA Reported Problems: Report consumes a lot of resources.  Inconsistent, doesn’t show prepayments anymore. Standard Epicor Report requires additional manual work to get this report as per our requirements: sorting by the currency, separating AP and Agents Commissions, check the totals. Profit & Loss Reported Problems: Report consumes a lot of resources and sometimes times out (even after updating timeout connection setups) Piles up balances over balances in not an efficient way. Inconsistent (adding an account segment value triggers issues with the subqueries grouping) When the report actually executes, takes 20/30 minutes to show up under the user request Categories not used in Epicor currently for segments.', 'Solution': ' Six S will analyze the reports and underlying queries as they currently exist. At the developer’s discretion, each query will then be modified or recreated in order to allow faster and more efficient execution. As much as possible, the design of the BAQs will be simplified. The corresponding RDL files (i.e., The visual aspect of the reports)  will be modified for compatibility with the redesigned queries. Although the data returned by the queries is not expected to change substantially, it is almost certain that there will be changes to field names, required groupings, etc. The overall layout and aesthetics of the reports will be maintained as much as possible, aside from changes specifically requested by GVA via their provided examples. Six S cannot guarantee specific performance targets until they have actually reviewed the reports and associated queries. Six S will provide GVA with guaranteed performance levels after their initial review. If these levels are not acceptable, further development can be halted. Six S expects to be increase performance very substantially, but needs to to do deeper analysis before promises can be made.', 'Components': 'Balance Sheet, Report, Refactor for improved efficiency and performance, Vendor Aging Report GVA, Report, Refactor for improved efficiency and performance, Profit & Loss, Report, Refactor for improved efficiency and performance'}

This function can execute on any arbitrary schedule, but this design assumes it will be executing approximately every 5 minutes. When this function is triggered, it will execute the following steps: Retrieve a list of all unconfirmed orders from Ariba. Review each order to determine if it already exists in Epicor. The PO Number will be used to identify orders within Epicor. If the order does not exist in Epicor, it will be created and left with the “Ready To Process” checkbox unchecked.

All ODBC and any other SQL connectivity that is not cloud compatible will be refactored out. Where possible, these queries will be replaced with BAQs.

Warehouse staff use Material Request Queue to pick the orders.  Orders need to be picked by PCID, eliminating the need to scan all the lot numbers within the PCID.  Only available PCID can be picked.   It’s important to build from the existing logic that’s in place already referring to:\n\nSixS Case ID: 1300 – Material Request Queue – Process Modifications The modified WIP / Material Movement Transaction form calculates the total qty of each lot, and the number of lots picked to the sales order.  Selecting the print option and clicking OK, will print a PCID label that includes the current total qty of parts included in the PCID along with the total number of lots included with the PCID.   (Lot in our terminology, means a box with parts in it.)  A PCID refers to a larger box / container that contains multiple lots.) The additional functionality of picking an existing PCID from stock that already contains a list of Lots, will  require that the total qty of parts was calculated, along with the total lots within the PCID.  This is required in order to select the print option and click OK, which would print out the PCID label. Creating the packing slip will follow our existing process, by selecting from picked orders to bring in all the line details into the packing slip.  This is a standard Epicor process.

These need to be generate/printed in bulk, before the earmolds arrive. This will allow Westone to assign a traceable number to all incoming items asap, when corresponding orders or jobs may not have been created yet. A dedicated screen will be created to allow Lot numbers to be associated with patient information. They also need a dashboard that will allow them to quickly review a lot number, identify its status, and locate any related Orders, Jobs, Invoices, and other documents. Additionally, UD fields will be added to the Order Entry screen so that lot numbers can be tracked for each order line. This data should be propagated to the invoice as well. Invoices should be automatically generated and emailed/printed when order lines are shipped. A function is needed to scan a directory, identify files, and attach them to the relevant lot number. Case Entry should be modified to display the lot number that corresponds to the related AR Invoice.', 'Solution': ' Order Entry A new “Lot Number” field will be added to the order line. This will be used to enter the lot number for the corresponding earmold. When a Lot Tracked earpiece is sold, a BPM will make this field mandatory.  This BPM will review the part class of the specified part to ensure that it is an earpiece as opposed to a ‘normal’ lot number part.    Invoice Entry The Lot Number from the corresponding order line will be displayed on the invoice line via a Foreign Key View. This will be a read only value. Case Entry A Lot Number field will be added within Case Entry. This will be a read only field that is populated via a Foreign Key View when an invoice number is entered on the case.  Label Printing  A new screen will be created to facilitate printing of cup labels for incoming earmolds. This screen will have three sections: New label printing This section will allow users to enter the number of sheets they would like printed. (Each sheet being 20 labels.) An Epicor Function will generate the corresponding lot numbers. Once lot numbers have been created, labels will be printed. Re-printing labels by shet This screen will allow users to enter a starting and ending lot number and print all labels in that range. Only lots that have not been assigned to an order will be printed. Reprint used labels This screen will allow users to individually print labels that have been associated with an order. This is screen is intended for exceptional situations where a label has been lost or damaged after being used.\ne.g., Label fell off of cup, label was accidentally damaged, etc Labels will display the following fields: Lot Number Time Stamp – Date and time that the label was printed Example of label layout: \t\n\t(Example of full label sheet has been attached to case in Six S’s system.)  Earmold Tracking This will be a dashboard allowing users to quickly see the info for the patient associated with a given Earmold.

The Person Contact records will be given a dedicated “Patient” role that will allow these records to be segregated from other, non-patient contact records. Screen will have the following fields: Lot Number Used to search and retrieve a lot record Patient ID Percon ID of an existing patient record. This can be used to directly assign a lot to an existing patient. Patient Information First Name Middle Name Last Name Age When a user saves a record on this screen, a new Person record will be created with the entered data. The ID of the resulting Person record will be associated with the lot.  Auto-attachment Function This will be an Epicor Function designed to run on a recurring schedule. The actual schedule is configurable within Epicor using built in functionality. This design assumes the scheduler will run on a roughly five minute interval, but other options should not present an issue. This function will review a specified directory to and review the files found therein. For each file, the following steps will take place: Look for a Lot Number that matches the file name. It is expected that each file will be prefixed with the barcode/lot number, or be similarly easily identified. If a Lot Number is NOT found, processing will continue to the next file. The expectation is that the lot will eventually be placed in Epicor and the file will be attached at that point. If a Lot Number is found, the file will be attached to the Lot Number. If attachment completes normally, the file will be deleted from the “Inbox”. If attachment fails for whatever reason, the file will be placed in an “Errors” subfolder.', 'Components': 'Order Entry, BPM, Enforce Lot Number entry, Order Entry, Layer, Add Lot Number field, Label Printing, New Screen, Allow printing and reprinting of labels, Case Entry, Layer, Display Lot Number, Label Tracking, Dashboard, Show lot/label status and associated transactions., Invoice Entry, Layer, Display Lot Number, Lot Assignment, New Screen, Allow association of lots and patients, Labels, Report, Cup Label'}

This bin will be used for all parts. The BPM that populates this value will validate that a “Fin-Goods” bin exists in the current warehouse. If the bin does not exist, no value will be populated.  Lot Validation After a lot number is entered a BPM will validate that the lot meets the following criteria: Lot number exists. Lot number is associated with the current part. There is quantity of the select part / lot available in the current bin. If the lot number fails to meet any of these criteria, a message will be displayed to the user alerting them of the issue. The field will then be emptied so that the user can enter an alternate lot number.  Quantity Population After entering a valid lot, a BPM will populate the quantity field with the Lot Quantity value for the current part. It is expected that all lot tracked parts will have a Lot Quantity specified. That said, if the current part does not have a Lot Quantity, nothing will be populated.  Maximum Lots Per PCID A customization and accompanying UD field will be added to the Part screen to allow entry of a “Max Lots Per PCID” value. This value will indicate the maximum number of lots of a given part that are permitted within a single PCID. A BPM will be added to the PCID Build / Split / Merge process. When a lot tracked part is added to a PCID: BPM will review the part and determine its “Max Lots Per PCID” value. If the value is 0, the BPM will complete. If the value is greater than zero, the BPM will determine the number of lots of the current part within the PCID.  If the addition of this lot would exceed the “Max Lots Per PCID” setting, an error will be displayed to the user and they will not be allowed to add the lot to the PCID. Note: \nThis validation will be done on a per part level. i.e., If a part has a “Max Lots Per PCID” of 10, a user will be able to add 10 lots of this part to a single PCID. The BPM will ignore any other parts that may be present in the PCID.  A new “Lot Count” field will be added to the destination side of the PCID Build / Split / Merge screen. This field will show the current number of lots currently within the PCID.

However, with the current configuration they do not print reliably and information is often missing.

Label changes will be limited to those needed to maintain compatibility with the new printing configuration and potentially simplifying the design. The appearance of the labels will not be changed. However, Blueprint currently has distinct report styles and data definitions for each of their three locations. Six S will unify these into a single label file, report style, and data definition for each transaction. Header information will be displayed dynamically based on the source of the print request. e.g., A label printed from Bermuda will show the Bermuda header. A label printed from Virginia will show the Virginia header, etc Labels are printed when the following transactions take place: PO Receipt to Job PO Receipt to Inventory Material Issue to Job Labels are printed in the following locations: Virginia – The ‘main’ warehouse VLM – Located in the main warehouse, but has a dedicated printer Bermuda warehouse Colorado warehouse  Auto-print BPMs The current BPMs that provide auto-print functionality will be removed and new BPMs created. Three BPMs will be created, one for each of the following transactions: PO Receipt to Job PO Receipt to Inventory Material Issue to Job BPMs will be designed to automatically print the label to the correct printer based on the user’s current workstation and the bin being received to or issued from. If a VLM bin is being used, the label will be sent to the printer located at the VLM. For all other bins, labels will be printed at the designated label printer of the warehouse. One workstation will be configured for each of Blueprint’s three locations, and an additional workstation for the VLM. Users will ensure their workstation is always set to the warehouse in which they are currently working.  Users will never need to select the VLM workstation as VLM labels will be identified by bin used in the related transaction. However, a workstation is being set up so that printer configuration will be the same for all locations. .', 'Components': 'Auto-print, BPMs, Recreate for reliable printing, Bartender, Labels, Merge duplicate labels, correct issues'}

This enables us to send to our customer a single invoice in cases where we have multiple lines of an order which require milestone invoices to take place. Currently one invoice is generated for each individual line of an order has milestone billing.  Our usual sales require a 25% deposit with order, 65% deposit prior to shipping, 10% on install. As an example, an order with 4 lines would generate 3 milestones. 4 x 3 = 12 invoices being sent out.', 'Problem': '  Conviron would like the milestone billing functionality to generate a single invoice per order, per milestone, regardless of the number of sales order lines that are on an order. e.g., If a project has 2 Sales Orders associated with it, with 3 lines each, and the 50% milestone is reached, two invoices’ will be created with 3 lines each, each corresponding to one of the sales orders and each line corresponding to a matching sales order line.', 'Solution': ' Invoice Entry The milestone billing function will have a BPM applied to affect the following changes: Rather than resulting in one invoice per sales order line for each completed Milestone, the process should result in one invoice per sales order with each sales order line being represented by a single invoice line. i.e., Each sales order line associated with a project will result in another line being present on a single invoice for that sales order rather than the creation of an additional invoice for each line. This will be a post-Processing method directive BPM. When this BPM is executed, it will review all invoices in the current group. If multiple invoices are found for the same project and order (i.e., Multiple milestones have been completed) all lines will be consolidated on the one invoice per milestone. After the lines have been consolidated, the extraneous invoices will be deleted from the group. e.g., If four invoices are created for an order for a project, (2 milestones completed for a sales order with 2 lines) the lines from the 2nd invoice will be moved to the 1st invoice which is for the first milestone and the lines from the 4th invoice will be moved to the 3rd invoice which is for the second milestone. The 2nd and 4th invoices will then be deleted, leaving one invoice per order per milestone with lines for each order line. If there were multiple orders involved, then it would be one invoice per order per milestone for all order lines and milestones. Here is an example output of the invoices going in and out: Starting Invoices/Lines: 1.1 2.1 3.1 4.1 Ending Invoices/lines: 1.1 1.2 3.1 3.2 Note:  All customizations will be performed in the Kinetic UI.', 'Components': ''}

The website uses the OpenCart platform for handling orders.  These orders will likely need to be handled via Multi-Company Direct process in most if not all cases in orders placed with Rieco-Titan, as production for Rieco-Titan is handled by Vindee, Industries. Current online order processing involves/requires: Orders are placed via OpenCart, then downloaded and entered manually into the existing system (E2). Desired online order processing in Kinetic:  Orders on website result in Sales Orders in Kinetic; this may require creating a new Customer record. OpenCart doesn’t have any reporting that would be usable for populating a DMT template. At very least, should be able to create a new Sales Order and Customer with little to no/minimal manual entry required.   Rachel Pavin General Manager\nRieco-Titan Products, Inc.\n965 Lambrecht Drive\nFrankfort, IL 60423\n  The customer is just starting CRP, so there is some urgency to getting this going for them.', 'Problem': '  Vindee Industries is currently operating an OpenCart-based shop.  They would like orders created in OpenCart to be automatically imported into Kinetic. Additionally, records should be created for the corresponding customers.', 'Solution': ' Six S will create a Function that connects to OpenCart and imports any orders that do not already exist in Kinetic. If the order’s customer does not have a record in Kinetic, a new customer will be created as well. The Function will run on a recurring schedule. It will support any schedule Vindee would like. However, this design assumes that it will be run on a relatively short interval, approximately every 5 minutes. When the function executes, the follow steps will be performed: Query OpenCart for a list of all orders created in the last 24 hours. Review each order to determine if it has already been imported into Kinetic. If the order has already been imported, it will be discarded and exempt from further processing. For each un-imported order, the Function will review the associated customer to determine if it already exists in Kinetic. If the customer does not exist in Kinetic, it will be created.  All created customers will have a UD field populated with the customer ID from OpenCart. Note: \nThis UD field will be used to match Kinetic customers to OpenCart customers. If a substantial number of OpenCart customers already exist in Kinetic, this value will need to be filled manually to prevent the creation of duplicate customers. An order in Kinetic will be created for each OpenCart order that was not previously imported. The shipping address for the order will be compared against the related customer record. If the address do not match, the order will be created with a One Time Ship To for the correct destination. All orders will have a UD field populated with the OpenCart order ID. This will be used to identify orders that have already been imported during future iterations of the Function.', 'Components': 'Order Creator, Function, Create orders, OpenCart Importer, Function, Query OpenCart for new orders, Customer Creator, Function, Create customers to support OpenCart orders'}

This spreadsheet is manually updated each day with data from the Shop Load report (PDF), the Employee Efficiency report (PDF), the Priority Dispatch report (PDF), a custom SSRS report (reading from the Vantage Progress database) called LaborDetailRunAll (Excel), a manually created LaborHours Adjustments report (Excel) and an EarnedHours report (Word) that comes from another database. For the most part the data from these reports is then manually entered onto their 5A Dashboard spreadsheet, which manipulates the data into usable charts and summaries. AccraFab would like to automate this to the extent possible. Current copies of the 5A Dashboard spreadsheet and the documents used in its creation are attached.', 'Problem': '  AccraFab is currently using an Excel workbook referred to as the “5A Dashboard” for management reporting. This worksheet relies on data from multiple reports both within and outside Vantage along with data from 3rd party databases.  Currently this data is gathered manually and copied into the worksheet whenever refreshed data is required. AccraFab would like Six S automate the process of updating the workbook to the maximum extent possible within a “realistic” budget.', 'Solution': ' Six S will review and analyze the reports that are currently used to collect the data for the 5A Dashboard. They will then create queries that retrieve the equivalent data. (Existing queries will be reused where possible.) The Excel workbook will then be configured to execute these queries and insert the data automatically whenever a user clicks a “Refresh” button. Note:\nThe exact refresh methodology may vary depending on the requirements of the various data sources. While it may not be a literal “Refresh” button, it will be something similarly easy to use.  Six S will contact AccraFab to arrange a meeting when development begins. The developer will need to review the current process of updating the dashboard so that they can capture nuance and specifics of the update process.', 'Components': '5A Dashboard, Excel Workbook, Add automatic update functionality.'}

I was kind of procrastinating and working with the old screen because of course the staff doesn’t like the kinetic screens, but it appears with the latest upgrade in Pilot it is running into issues with our customization in the classic screen, so rather than spending money fix the old screen we might as well go forward and get the kinetic version working properly. Can you arrange some time for me to get this switched over?  The kinetic screen we already built works. It just needs some tweaking on when the calculations are run as when we clicked the save to do the calculations it saved the received amount which caused issues.   This is the error for the classic screen, but I am not too worried about fixing it as we won’t use it going forward.     .', 'Problem': '  The changes to the receiving process delivered as part of case 2441 are no longer functing since the most recent upgrade of Manitoba Starch’s pilot environment. They would like this customization ported to the Kinetic UI. Work has already been done to this end, however, there are currently some issues with the timing/triggering of calculations. Manitoba does not need the classic version of the customization repaired. However, Six S will perform a cursory review the customization and if the needed corrections are sufficiently minor, they will be made.

2023-11-30 13:46:57,162 - services.caseService - INFO - texts_and_types for case 2890: {'Need': ' \xa0The need is to print WIP status Serial Numbers, which are assigned to jobs, at the time when labour quantity is Reported on related Operations. The Serial Numbers are generated in the standard method with the Serial Number Assignment program. Later, when production quantities are reported on the job operations related to these serialized part numbers, we need the ability to print the appropriate number of job assigned serial numbers to a Dymo label printer. Please note that standard functionality, there is no means to “Print” a Serial Number in the Epicor Application. Another required functionality is the ability to “Reprint” any Serial Number.  MES – Report Quantity Screen Production reporting occurs with the MES. The employee will use “Report Quantity” program to enter the number of units completed at the given operation. At this point, the appropriate number of job assigned serial numbers must be printed. Scoping call with Tom suggested that a user defined field be added (Boolean) to the serial number table to document if a serial number has been printed. When printing serial number(s), the user must see a message box confirming which serial number(s) printed. The “Print Serial Number Tags” button, added to the “Report Quantity” screen should be made bold and differentiated from other fields on the form. We want to prevent accidental printing of serial numbers at downstream operations that are not supposed to use this functionality. The location of the button should not be near the “Print Tags” button as a further mistake-proofing means. The unbound textbox for the quantity to print should default to “2”. (See screenshot below) On click, print the next serial number(s) in sequence (depending on quantity reported) that has not yet been printed. Only mark those serial numbers as printed when users have moved on (to report another quantity, finish job, etc) to allow for reprints.   Separate Screen for Printing Any Serial Number Users can type in any serial number (except those voided or scrapped) and choose the quantity to print This reprint functionality should reside on a separate program, not be built into to the Report Quantity program.  Serial Number Tag Report (see sample) New Bartender label  1 1/8 ”x3 1/2” or 29mmx89mm Fields = Product ID, Product Description, Serial Number Barcode of Serial Number QR Code of Serial Number    .', 'Problem': '  Minus Forty needs a new feature that allows for printing of WIP Serial Numbers tied to jobs when labor quantities for associated operations are reported. When production numbers are recorded, an equivalent count of job-associated serial numbers should be printed via a label printer.  This feature should also allow the reprinting of any Serial Number.  Regarding the MES – Report Quantity Screen: Workers record production output through the MES using the “Report Quantity” program. Upon logging completed units and selecting a “Print Serial Tags” button the corresponding number of associated serial numbers tags should print. The fact that the serial number tag has been printed should be tracked on the serial number table and the user should get a notification listing the serial numbers that have been sent to the printer.   The button should be kept separate from the other buttons on the screen to avoid accidental clicks by users.   The system should print the next unprinted serial number(s) in sequence upon button activation. These numbers should be marked as printed only when users complete the reporting of quantity.  For the Serial Number Tag Report: A Bartender label exists that includes the following info:  Product ID, Product Description, and Serial Number This label template needs to be updated to accept the data being passed to it from Epicor.', 'Solution': " Six S will complete the following:  Serial Number Printing: Two new objects will be added to the Report Qty Screen:  Print Serial Tags Button: This will trigger the printing of serial tags for the given report qty session. This button will be red to differentiate it from the other fields on the screen.  Tags Per Serial Number Text Box: This will default to “2” and is the number of tags to print per serial number. This can be overridden by manually typing in another number.  When the Print Serial Tags button is clicked the following will occur:  A function will retrieve the serial numbers to print by looking at the qty entered in the current report qty session and taking that qty of serial numbers list of serial numbers assigned to this job. Note that it will only grab serial numbers where the print status field is empty, and the serial number is not marked as voided or scraped.  It will then collect the workstation the user is logged into as well as all other needed values from the report qty screen and send a file to bartender for printing.  Bartender will ingest the file and print on the correct printer based on the user’s workstation.  When serial numbers are submitted for printing, the print status field will be set to “submitted” after the qtys are reported an additional BPM will run that change all print status from submitted to printed for the current job.   Serial Number Tags: The serial number tags have a bartender label template ready that needs to be updated to accept the following data from Epicor: Product ID, Product Description, Serial Number   Notes:  It is assumed for the purposes of this design doc that BarTender is already set up in the client's environment, and the correct credentials will be provided to us. Six S Can perform this setup, however that is not included in this scope.  Workstation and printer mapping are considered out of scope for this design document. We assume that the necessary information will be provided to us for proper implementation.  All users with access to the screens will have access to the new functions. No additional access control restrictions will be implemented for these features  If no available printer can be found to print to based on the workstation being printed from, an error will be thrown stating as such.  All customizations will be developed in the Kinetic environment.  Serial number re printing from a custom screen is not in scope for this design.", 'Components': 'Tags Per Serial Number Text Box, UI Element / App Studio Layer, Specifies the number of tags to print per serial number, defaulting to 2, Print Serial Tags Button, UI Element / App Studio Layer, Triggers the printing of serial tags for the given report qty session, Serial Number Retrieval, Function, Retrieves the appropriate serial numbers to print based on the reported quantity, Serial Number Tag Report, BarTender Report, Update the Bartender label for printing serial number tags, Bartender Integration, Function, Handles the printing process for serial number tags'}

Additionally, pegged Sales Order, Line, and Release information should be recorded on the job.', 'Solution': ' To accomplish this, Six S will make the following changes: Production Planner Workbench: Add a "Firm" checkbox to the Jobs grid. Add a "Firm Jobs" button to the screen. When clicked, any job with the "Firm" checkbox marked as true will be firmed using standard Epicor functionality.  The screen will refresh to display the updated job statuses. If the user selects the “firm” checkbox on a job that is already firm, nothing will happen to said job.  A notification will display after jobs have been firmed that notes the qty of jobs firmed.  Add a “Release” checkbox to the Jobs grid.  Add a “Release Jobs” button to the screen. When clicked, any job with the “Release” checkbox marked as true will be released using standard Epicor functionality.  The screen will refresh to display the updated job statuses. If the user selects the “release” checkbox on a job that is already released, nothing will happen to said job.  A notification will display after jobs have been released that notes the qty of jobs released.  Change the Planner field into a dropdown field that displays a list of workforces.  Firm Job BPM: This BPM will run whenever any job is firmed. This BPM will automatically lock the Qty and Schedule fields on the firmed job.

At the last operation in the Bill of Materials, we need shop floor employees using MES to have the ability to print certain documents such as the wiring diagram associated with the part if one exists. Base parts are then used in the manufacturing of Final parts.  .', 'Problem': 'Minus Forty has various labels that print on the final operation for their cabinets. They also have several key inputs such as test data that need to be inputted on this final operation before said labels are printed.   Labels to Print: There are a more than a dozen different labels that can be printed including, wiring diagrams, name plates, warning and shipping tags, customer specific labels, static labels etc. When reporting that a unit is complete the tags associated with that unit must be printed. The tags to print will come from the serial and part tables. All labels are to be printed through bartender on the bartender printer linked to the workstation the report qty operation is being performed on. This label printing functionality should apply to ALL parts on all report qty screens However, there needs to be a way to only make labels print on the final operation or a specific operation for the job rather than ALL operations. There should be a “print labels” button that triggers label printing  Data Input: The main data input for an end user is the serial number. The user should be able to scan the serial number tag on the unit they are reporting to start the report qty process. This is a change to the normal process of selecting a active operation before opening the report qty screen. There are additional data entry fields that also need to be filled in: •\tColdest Temperature •\tWarmest Temperature •\tMinutes to Zero •\tInspector (This is automatically the Employee ID of the person doing the entry and not editable) •\tClosing Comments •\tHigh Pot and Continuity (Boolean Field) • The reported qty for these operations is ALWAYS one unit so the current qty field should be hidden and automatically set to 1 for each report qty session for final operations.  Information Fields: There are several data points that need to be shown on the report qty screen as a visual aid for the end user. These are as follows •\tSales Order #: Only shown when this is a make to order job, then this shows the value from the first make to order demand link on the job •\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the Job •\tWiring Diagram: There are also several additional data points that need to be shown that come from lower-level serial numbers. These serial numbers are for the parts that went into the base or conversion cabinet serial number that is currently being reported against. They can be found by looking at matched serial numbers that have a part class as listed beside each field: •\tCompressor Serial #: Part Class (COMP) •\tController (T Stat) Serial #: Part Class (CONT) •\tEvaporator Serial #: Part Class (EVAP) •\tGateway Serial #: Part Class (IOT) o\tSim Card #: Comes from the Sim Card# field on the serial table for the Gateway above. o\tWifi Password: Comes from the Wifi Password Field on the serial table for the gateway above. Additional Notes: The label printing changes can apply to all parts however the input and field display changes ONLY apply to jobs that are making parts with the class “CABINET BASE” or “CABINET FINAL” For any other parts these additional fields should be hidden or deactivated.', 'Solution': 'To address the requirements stated in the problem statement, we will develop a solution that modifies the existing Report Qty screen and introduces custom label printing functionality for Minus Forty. Labels Setup 1.\tLabel Report Styles: A new UD Code; “Part Label”, will be created. Any UD Code entries of this type will be available for selection as a part label in the part labels grid. To add new UD code the user can copy the report style ID and paste it into the key field for the Part Label UD Code. Upon attempting to add a new UD Code record of the Part Label Type a BPM will display an error if the Report Style Does not exist in Epicor. The following BPMs will also be added: a.\tWhen a report style is deleted from report style maintenance if the report style is being used on a PartLabel UD code an error will be thrown. b.\tWhen a PartLabel UD code is deleted from UD Code Maintenance, if the PartLabelUD code is being used on any parts an error will be throw.  2.\tPart Labels Grid: A new grid panel will be added to Part Entry. This grid will be tied to a UD table in Epicor and it will list the following: a.\tPartLabel (drop down of all PartLabel UDCodes) b.\tLabelQty (Qty of this specific label to print) This will allow users to add the different label styles that should be printed for any given part as well as their qty’s  Serial Numbers Entry and Creation The following UD fields will be added to the serial number table as well as the serial number entry screen. 1.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal 2.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal 3.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal 4.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. 5.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox The UD Codes for customer asset tags will be adjusted so that they point to specific report styles this will work the same way labels for parts work as listed above with the exception that only a single Special Label can be selected for a serial number and this field already exists so no additional adjustment will be needed. The BPMs to support deletion of these reports and UD Codes will be added. Report Qty 6.\tAdd the following: a.\tSerial Number: A field where users can scan or manually input the serial number. b.\tColdest Temperature: Decimal c.\tWarmest Temperature: Decimal d.\tMinutes to Zero: Decimal e.\tClosing Comments: Multi-line text box. f.\tHigh Pot and Continuity: Checkbox  7.\tHide the following: a.\tResource, Resource Name, Next Assembly, Next Opr Seq, Revision, PCID, Lot, Request Move, Attribute Set, Total Qty and UOM, Print Contents, Serial Numbers Button, Generate PCID Button, Next Lot Button, Co Parts Tab, Labor Equipment Tab, Inspection Data Button  8.\tMake the following Read Only: a.\tCurrent Qty and UOM b.\tJob c.\tAssembly d.\tOperation  9.\tAdd the following read only fields For the specific fields that need to display data from lower-level serial numbers (e.g., compressor serial, controller serial, evaporator serial, gateway serial), fetch the data by searching for matched serial numbers with the required part classes.  Only show serial numbers that are not marked as scrapped. Additionally, retrieve the Sim Card# and Wifi Password values from the relevant fields on the serial table for the gateway a.\tSales Order # Only shown for make-to-order jobs, populated from the first make-to-order demand link on the job. b.\tProduct #: Production Part Number for the job. c.\tCompressor Serial # d.\tController Serial # e.\tEvaporator Serial # f.\tGateway Serial # g.\tSim Card # h.\tWifi Password  10.\tSerial Number Entry: Upon opening Report Qty the user can enter a serial number in the serial number field, when populated this will automatically change the report qty job to the job the serial number is matched to. a.\tIf the serial number does not exist display an error message b.\tIf the user is not clocked into the job the serial number is matched to, display an error message. When a valid serial number is entered and it is the last operation on the job for a final or base cabinet then set the current qty to “1”  11.\tClosing Report Qty and Printing Labels When the user presses the “Ok” button to report the qty: a.\tAttempt to print labels: i.\tRetrieve the list of reports and respective qty’s to print from the Part Master for the production part on the job. ii.\tCheck the serial number for the current Report Qty session to determine if there is an additional special label to be printed. iii.\tPrint all labels through bartender to the printer linked to the current workstation. iv.\tShow a message to the user asking if all labels printed correctly, if the user selects yes then continue, if not attempt to reprint labels again. This loop continues until the user selects yes. b.\tSave the values for ALL input fields to the serial number being reported against.  Auto Receive to Inventory After reporting qty on the last operation for a job where the part Is a final or base cabinet based on part class, automatically complete the job receipt to inventory for the serial number and job entered in the Report Qty Screen. These will be received to the default bin for the workstation.  Enable Functionality on Last Op for Cabinets Only Due to how the Report Qty screen works there will always be a job, assembly and operation already populated on this screen. All the functionality described on this document except will be disabled if: •\tThe user has not entered a serial number. •\tThe production part for the job selected is not in one of the following part classes: o\tCabinet Base o\tCabinet Final •\tThe operation being reported against is not one of the following operations: o\tOPERATION CODE TO BE DETERMINED This means that if conditions are not met, standard report qty functionality will work. The hidden fields can remain hidden, and standard fields that were made read only can remain editable.  Assumptions: •\tAll Labels to be printed require ONLY the serial number as a parameter, all other data such as part, or order data will be retrieved through the serial number. •\tBartender is setup in the customers environment and printers and workstations are linked correctly. •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic environment •\tWorkstations have been setup with default bins', 'Components': ''}

Instead, we work with a large number of service technicians across the US and Canada (these have been added to our Suppliers list under the SERV group) When call comes in, we need to enter and pull information related to either the base serial number, the final serial number or the customer asset # (case 2850).  Related information includes compressor and other serial numbers related to the unit as well as closing information We also show other related information, such as related parts from BOM that may be useful in troubleshooting and other cases associated with that unit We need addresses and contact information for four things Customer on the Order Current location (may be ship to but may not be – is often not in the system at all) Third party information (as some customers have call centre mediate the process) Choose and pull location and contact information for service technician Need to be able to easily generate a repair order for a technician that includes notes Have a way for the service technician to invoice us and to match back to case Need to be able to easily generate SO; will need to indicate 0 cost for warranty items while still recording the cost (for tax purposes).  Any of the addresses (buyer, location, tech, third party) can be chosen as a ship to We will also need a way to store serial number, part and customer IDs from legacy system (using Epicor IDs) in order to service customers on Go Live .', 'Problem': 'Minus Forty needs a new case process to handle warranty and service requests. Currently, they do not have a way to track and manage these requests in an efficient manor in Epicor. When a customer calls in with a warranty or service request, the representative needs easy access to all relevant information in one place. This includes serial numbers, related cases, parts, addresses, and contacts for the customer, equipment location, third parties, and service technicians. The system should allow the representative to create a case, pull in related information, select correct addresses and contacts, create order lines for parts and services, and generate repair orders for technicians. Key requirements: •\tSingle easy to use interface for the representative to manage a service/warranty request •\tSearch and retrieval of serial number and related case information •\tSave contacts and addresses for customer, equipment location, service company, and call center company •\tCreate order lines for parts and services to facilities repair •\tGenerate repair orders for customers. •\tCapture supplementary data not already in ERP', 'Solution': 'Layout and Fields: The layout will be modified so that there are 4 main panel; Details, Lower Level Serial Numbers, Parts, and Services. All other panels will remain visible but will be below these panels in the hierarchy and rather than remove unused fields entirely they will be moved into the “related Information” panel. Details Panel: The details panel will be arranged as seen here:  Field settings and details are as follows: Item\tField\tNotes: 1\tExisting Case Field\tNo changes 2\tExisting Owner Field\tThis field needs to auto populate from the workforce that the user who created the case is linked to. When this field is changed it should also auto populate the person/contact field for this same case with the same workforce. (IE keep Owner and Person/Contact synced) 3\tExisting Serial Number Field\tDefault search for this field should be the serial number quick search defined below. 4\tExisting Task Set Field\tShould auto populate to the “Service” task set for all new cases 5\tNew Shape\tShould appear whenever the serial number in the current case already has other cases associated with it. 6\tExisting Customer Field\tNo Changes 7\tExisting Customer contact field \tNo Changes 8\tNew Customer Address Field\tDisplay a read only text box with the address for the customer from item 6 in this list. 9\tNew Customer Equipment Location Field\tCannot use existing ship to field as that defaults based on the order and we need to change this value manually. This should allow selection from a drop down of all active ship to records for the customer from item 6 on this list. 10\tNew Equipment Location Contact Field\tDrop down selection of contacts combined from the customer in item 6 and the equipment location ship to in item 9. Meaning all Customer contacts from Item 6 and all ship to contacts from item 9 will be available for selection. 11\tNew Equipment Location Address Field \tDisplay a read only text box with the address for the equipment location ship to from item 9 in this list. 12\tNew Service Company Field\tDefault search for this field should be the service company quick search defined below. This field should allow any Vendor ID to be saved to it. The quick search will limit selectable vendors to only those marked as service companies. 13\tNew Service Company Contact Field\tDrop down list of all contacts attached to the vendor record saved to the field in item 12. 14\tNew Service Company Address\tDisplay a read only text box with the address for the service company from item 12 in this list. 15\tNew Call Center Company Field\tDefault search for this field should be the call center company quick search defined below. This field should allow any Vendor ID to be saved to it. The quick search will limit selectable vendors to only those marked as call center companies. 16\tNew Call Center Company Contact Field\tDrop down list of all contacts attached to the vendor record saved to the call center company field (item 15) 17\tNew Call Center Company Address Field\tDisplay a read only text box with the address for the call center company (item 15) 18\tExisting case description field\tNo changes 19\tExisting pack slip field\tNo changes 20\tExisting pack slip line field\tNo Changes 21\tNew Manufacturing Date field \tRead only field, data source TBD. Requires warranty process to be fully understood first. Leave this blank for now. 22\tNew Warranty End Date Field\tRead only field, data source TBD. Requires warranty process to be fully understood first. Leave this blank for now. 23\tNew Days Remaining Field \tRead only field, data source TBD. Requires warranty process to be fully understood first. Leave this blank for now.  All other fields that were originally in the case details section will be moved to the “related information” panel.    Parts Panel: A new parts panel will be added below the case details panel. This panel will be used to add parts to orders for this case to be shipped out for repairs to be made:  Item\tField\tNotes: 1\tNew DefaultShipTo field\tDropdown selection of the following options: Customer, Equipment Location, Service Company, Call Center Company. This is defaulted to Customer for all new cases until changed manually by the user. 2\tNew Part grid\tThis grid will allow the user to add, change or remove order lines to linked orders on this case. It will directly display all order lines for all linked orders where the part class is NOT “Service”. If there are no linked orders or order lines that match this criteria than nothing will display. Field\tSource\tNotes Part\tOrderDtl.PartNum\tStandard part field that allows for part search. Description\tOrderDtl.LineDesc\tStandard Field Qty\tOrderDtl. SellingQuantity\tStandard Field Unit Price\tOrderDtl.DocUnitPrice\tMust pull value from the price list tables as a normal order line would when new lines are added. Warranty\tOrderDtl.Warranty_c\tThis will be marked as true by default when new lines are added if the Warranty Days remaining is greater than 0. The user can change this manually as needed. ExtPrice\tOrderDtl.DocTotalPrice\tWill show the total price for this line. Ship To\tOrderDtl.CaseShipTo_c\tWhen new lines are added these defaults from the selection made on the shipto field detailed in (item 1) of this list. This is a dropdown field with the same options and will be user editable    Services Panel: A new services panel will be added below the parts panel. This panel will be used to add services parts to orders for this case to be completed. Services parts are parts that have a part class of “Service” they are non-stock, non-quantity bearing parts that are used to purchase services from service companies and charge customers for services when needed.  The grid will allow the user to add change or remove order lines linked to orders on this case provided that those order lines have parts with the class of service on them. If there are no linked orders or order lines that match this criteria than nothing will display. Field\tSource\tNotes Service\tOrderDtl.PartNum\tStandard part field that allows for part search. Description\tOrderDtl.LineDesc\tRead only field, should populate with part description when a new line is added even before line is saved. Estimated Hours\tOrderDtl.EstSvcHours_c\tStandard Field, will default based on logic listed below. Actual Hours\tOrderDtl.SellingQuantity\tStandard field. It is assumed that ALL Services parts are sold in hours and this is a qty of hours that is being sold. This field will be filled in manually when the user knows how many hours the service company actually used for this service. Service Hourly Rate\tOrderDtl.ServiceRate_c\tWhen a new line is added this value will be retrieved from the Vendor Price List for the vendor listed in the “Service Company” field based on the current service part line. Selling Hourly Rate\tOrderDtl.DocUnitPrice\tStandard Field, will default based on customer price lists through standard functionality. Will be $0 if no price lists exists for customer or part record. Warranty\tOrderDtl.Warranty_c\tThis will be marked as true be default when new lines are added if the Warranty Days remaining is greater than 0. The user can change this manually as needed. ExtPrice\tOrderDtl.DocTotalPrice\tWill show the total price for this line.  Lower Level Serial Numbers Panel: This panel will be added directly below the services panel. It will display a list of ALL lower-level serial numbers for the current serial number on the case.   Functionality: Creating New Order Lines The parts and services panel not only display order lines for linked orders but will also support creating these order lines. When a part is added to either of the grids the following logic will be used to save those lines to orders and create new orders. This is also the time in which we will populate and save values for any fields that default from another location or calculation. Finding or Creating an Order: 1.\tWhen a line is added via either the service or parts grid check to see if there is an order linked to the case where ready to process is not true and nothing has been shipped. 2.\tIf one is found, then use that order 3.\tIf none are found, create a new order for the customer listed as the sold to customer on the case. Creating Part Order Lines: The Order.CaseLineType_c value for Part Order Lines will be set to “Part”.  Some fields on the order line will need to be automatically changed at time of order line creation/change. 1.\tWarranty: This field will be used to automate the discount amount on the order If warranty is true then discount = 100% else 0%. Warranty will default to true if the number of warranty days remaining is greater than zero for the serial number on the case the order line is being created from. 2.\tCaseShipTo: This value will default to match the value selected on the DefaultShipToField from the case the order line is being created from. This will determine the shipping method for the release for this line. One Time Ship To will be marked as true for all orders and the name, address and contact information for the selected DefaultShipTo will be copied into the One Time Ship To fields for the order release.  After a line is created and saved, if the user then changes the CaseShipTo field on this line as long as no qty on the line has been shipped the one time ship to address will change to match the new selection.  When attempting to set the One Time Ship to Record if any of the ID, Name or Address fields from the Corresponding CaseShipTo_C record are blank then an error will be thrown stating that the record cannot be saved because the selected Ship To is missing information.    Creating Service Order Lines: Service order lines are different than parts in that they do not have a specific ship to location, as they are a representation of the work that was completed. The Order.CaseLineType_c value for Service Lines will be set to “Service”.  The following will occur when a service line is added: 1.\tWarranty: This field will be used to automate the discount amount on the order If warranty is true then discount = 100% else 0%. Warranty will default to true if the number of warranty days remaining is greater than zero for the serial number on the case the order line is being created from. 2.\tEstHours: This field will default based on a lookup from a UD table that has following fields: •\tServicePart: The service part number ie (Repair Compressor) •\tPart: The part the service is being completed on. IE Base Cabinet, Conversion Cabinet, Compressor etc. •\tEstHours: How many hours it should take to complete said service on said part. When a new service line is added, the value for this field will use the following logic to retrieve the estimated hours: •\tRetrieve the part for the current serial number on this case. •\tIs there a record in the UD table for the current combination of aforementioned serial part and the service part for this order line. •\tIf yes, then retrieve the EstHours from that matching row. 3.\tServiceRate: This is the price the service company charges minus 40 for a given service. If a supplier price list exists for the vendor saved to the service company field and the part for the current order line is on said price list than that price will be populated in this field. Otherwise a default value of $HOWMANYDOLLARS? Will be used. Changing ShipTo Locations and Contacts on the Case After an order is linked to the case if the user attempts to change The Customer or Vendor record for the CaseShipTo that is linked to any given row they will receive an error letting them know “This record to has been used as a ShipTo on a linked order line and cannot be changed”. IE If the CaseShipTo_c record for an order line is set to “Service Company” then the address and contact information for the selected service company on the case will be the One Time Ship To information for that order line release. If then at the case level the user selects a different service company in the case details panel they will be met with an error stating that they cannot change the service company as that service company is marked as the ship to for an order line. Changing an Order Line After Release / Shipment Orders cannot be change after they are marked as ready to process, an error will appear if an attempt is made. To make a change to an order ready to process must be marked as false. After an order has been shipped change attempts will also result in an error.  Releasing Orders When orders and order lines are first created the ready to process flag is not marked as true. This will be marked as true automatically after the “Approve Quote” task in the case task list is completed. This is done so that a user can add order lines to a case and then assign the Approve Quote task to their manager. The manager can open the case confirm the lines look good and mark their task as complete and the order will automatically be released for shipping.  Drop Shipping Service Lines and Creating Purchase Orders Service Part lines although they are placeholders for operations still need to be shipped in Epicor. To accomplish this we will utilize drop shipping. Each service line will be marked as drop ship and the drop ship vendor will be the vendor selected in the service company field in case.  When the “Close Case” task is completed, it will trigger the following actions: 1.\tA PO will be generated for ALL service order lines across any orders that are linked to the current case. This is provided a previous PO has not already been generated manually to fulfill the demand. The Price and Qty for each line will come from the OrderDtl.ServiceRate_c and OrderDtl.SellingQuantity. 2.\tA drop shipment will be completed against each created PO line to immediately close out all created PO’s and mark all order lines as shipped. This will cause all shipments to be ready to pull into invoicing.  Quick Searches Several quick searches will be required to accommodate the special circumstances for search in several fields. These will be created by Six S with basic fields but can be expanded on by Minus Forty to accommodate their needs. •\tSerial Number o\tThis quick search will be made the default quick search for EVERY serial number field in Epicor. Including search criteria are; Serial Number, Asset Tag Number and Part Number. •\tService Company (Vendor) o\tThis quick search will be made the default quick search for only the Service Company text box on the case details screen. It will show only suppliers where the Supplier Group is “Service”. Included Search Criteria: Supplier ID, Supplier Name, Country, State, City •\tCall Center Company (Vendor) o\tThis quick search will be made the default quick search for only the Call Center Company text box on the case details screen. It will show only suppliers where the Supplier Group is “Service”. Included Search Criteria: Supplier ID, Supplier Name, Country, State, City •\tPart o\tThis quick search will be made the default quick search for EVERY part field in Epicor. It will include the following fields: Part, Description, Part Class. This is so that users can sort by part class IE “Service Parts” when adding rows.      Call Log Customs The call log view will be modified to show the Call Type at the top of each call in the list view rather than the lowest level contact.  Additionally, whenever a case task is completed a new call log will be entered with a type of “Task Completed” with the following information in the call notes: •\tTask: •\tCompleted By: •\tTask Comments: This will ensure that a user can use the call log as a single source of case history.  Notes: •\tAll customizations will be completed in the Kinetic Environment •\tThe repair order document will be generated form this case information but is not ins scope for this case.', 'Components': ''}

Additionally, you may need to update any relevant marketing materials to reflect the new discount policy."}

2023-12-19 16:25:39,869 - services.omnaiService - DEBUG - Response: {'response': "Based on the documentation provided, there is no direct mention of a built-in feature specifically designed to prevent employees from logging into multiple jobs at once in the Manufacturing Execution System (MES). The documentation focuses on restricting who can enter time for a specific employee, disallowing self-time entry, defining time entry options, setting up approvals for time entries, and restricting time entry to certain employees, among other related topics.\n\nTo address the issue of an employee logging into multiple jobs at once, you may need to explore the system's configuration options or consider customization. Customization might involve creating a rule or script that checks if an employee is already logged into a job before allowing them to log into another one. However, this is not explicitly covered in the provided documentation, so it would be advisable to consult with the software provider or a technical expert who can provide guidance on whether this functionality can be achieved within the existing system capabilities or if it would require additional development."}
